//! The Bases toolbar: the view switcher and the five panels its controls
//! open.
//!
//! Observed (`tools/obsidian-probe/results/2026-10-25-bases.json`; the prose
//! is in
//! [[Specification#Observed Bases write behavior, Obsidian 1.14.5 (installer build 1.13.7)]]):
//! the toolbar does **not** open menus of rows. Each control opens a
//! `.menu.bases-toolbar-menu` whose body is a panel —
//!
//! - **sort** and **group**: `.combobox-button` pairs (property, direction)
//!   with a `lucide-trash-2` button;
//! - **filter**: a `<select class="conjunction">` (`and`/`or`/`not`) per
//!   group, then a property combobox, an operator combobox, a value input and
//!   a `filer-expression-mode-toggle` (`lucide-code-xml`) per rule, in two
//!   sections, "All views" and "This view";
//! - **properties**: a checkbox list of every property with "Add *name*
//!   property", "Add formula" and "Hide all";
//! - **results**: a "Limit number of results" number input and the rows
//!   *Show all (n)*, *Copy to clipboard* and *Export CSV...*.
//!
//! The views menu lists one row per view, and the row's own icon opens that
//! view's settings (the Configure view page), whose Layout combobox offers
//! exactly `table`, `cards`, `list` and `kanban`.
//!
//! What the panels write is [`BasesView::edit_view`] and
//! [`BasesView::edit_base`]'s business: *Sort Z → A* **prepends**
//! `{property, direction: DESC}` to the view's `sort`, *Hide column* removes
//! the property from `order`, and the limit input writes `limit` as a bare
//! number.
//!
//! Every write below goes through one of those two closures and through
//! `scoria_bases::layout`'s setters, so the bytes are `Base::to_yaml`'s and
//! nothing here serializes anything. The free functions at the bottom of the
//! module are where each rule lives, which is why they take a `&mut View` or
//! a `&mut Option<Filter>` rather than the element: the tests at the end
//! apply one and assert the written bytes.
//!
//! **Unprobed, and therefore not drawn or not written.** Three observed
//! controls are deliberately missing, because what each writes cannot be
//! derived from the run:
//!
//! - the properties panel's **"Hide all"**. `order` is exactly the shown
//!   columns, so hiding every column wants an empty `order` — but
//!   `scoria_formats::base::View` never writes an empty `order` (the key is
//!   omitted), and a view with no `order` shows the *implied* columns, which
//!   is the opposite of hiding all. So the key "Hide all" writes is unknown.
//! - the properties panel's **"Add formula"**, whose dialog was never opened,
//!   so neither the formula name it writes nor its statement is observed.
//! - the results panel's ***Export CSV...***, whose file, location and
//!   dialect were never observed.
//!
//! Also unprobed and so not written: the *Summarize...* submenu and what a
//! summary chosen from the UI writes (`summaries` is read and round-tripped,
//! never written by a control here); the key the list layout's "Indent
//! properties" toggle writes (`layout::INDENT_PROPERTIES_KEY` is the plain
//! spelling and nothing writes it, so the toggle is not drawn); renaming a
//! view through the Configure view page's name field, so that page shows the
//! name as text; and whether `groupOrder` is ever written by the UI, so
//! nothing here writes or clears one.
//!
//! **Unprobed metrics.** No toolbar rect was measured in the run: the bar's
//! height, its padding, the gap between controls, and which `lucide-*` icon
//! each control carries are all this module's own. The height is the 30 px of
//! the table's header row, which is the one measured row of the view.
