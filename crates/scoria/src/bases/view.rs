//! The element that draws a `.base`, and the state behind it.
//!
//! This module is the shell: it holds the parsed file, the view that is
//! showing, the table that view resolved to, and the writes the view makes.
//! The drawing itself belongs to a layout —
//! [`table`](crate::bases::table), [`cards`](crate::bases::cards),
//! [`list`](crate::bases::list) and [`kanban`](crate::bases::kanban), the
//! four layouts Obsidian registers — each of which adds its own methods to
//! [`BasesView`] and keeps its own state in one of its fields. The toolbar
//! above them is [`toolbar`](crate::bases::toolbar) and editing a cell is
//! [`edit`](crate::bases::edit).
//!
//! What the shell itself draws is the two states that are not a layout, both
//! observed (`tools/obsidian-probe/results/2026-10-25-bases.json`; the prose
//! is in
//! [[Specification#Observed Bases table view, Obsidian 1.14.5 (installer build 1.13.7)]]):
//!
//! - a **parse error** as `.bases-error`, two paragraphs: the banner
//!   [`PARSE_ERROR_BANNER`] and then the message, with nothing joining them;
//! - an **unknown view type** as the same block with one paragraph,
//!   "Unknown view type: x", and no rows.
//!
//! **Writing.** Obsidian writes a base on a toolbar change and canonicalizes
//! it on close, and never writes one that failed to parse. So does this: a
//! change goes through [`BasesView::edit_view`] or
//! [`BasesView::edit_base`], which re-resolve the table from the parsed file
//! and emit [`BasesEvent::Edited`]; the workspace's save path asks for
//! [`BasesView::file_contents`] — `Base::to_yaml`, Obsidian's own bytes — and
//! hands the written text back to [`BasesView::mark_saved`] so the watcher
//! can tell the view's own write from somebody else's.
