//! What the binary carries with it: the icons the shell draws, the logo it
//! signs the window with, and the interface font it falls back to.
//!
//! The icons are Lucide's (ISC, `assets/icons/LICENSE`), fetched from the
//! Lucide repository rather than from any Obsidian bundle; Obsidian names
//! the Lucide icon each control uses in its DOM (`svg.lucide-search`), and
//! that name is what [`icon`] takes. The font is Inter (SIL OFL,
//! `assets/fonts/LICENSE-Inter.txt`), the family at the head of Obsidian's
//! own interface and text font stacks, in the static faces the pinned gpui
//! can pick weights from (a variable font renders every weight as regular).
//! The logo is ours, drawn for the project; see `docs/img/` for the master.
