//! The canvas element: paints a `.canvas` file and takes the mouse and the
//! keyboard over it.
//!
//! Everything that is not gpui lives in `scoria_canvas` — the viewport
//! math, hit testing, snapping, the `Scene` with its selection and undo
//! history. This file is the glue: one `canvas()` element that lays out each
//! visible card's content (from `Cards`) in prepaint, paints the dot grid,
//! groups, edges, card frames, content, selection and handles in paint, and
//! registers the mouse listeners; a key context for the shortcuts; and the
//! small gpui trees around it (the zoom controls, the colour palette, the
//! parse error). Persistence is the workspace's: the view says when it was
//! edited and hands over `to_json()`; the workspace owns the timer and the
//! vault's write path, as it does for the editor.
//!
//! Sections: state, input, painting, persistence.
