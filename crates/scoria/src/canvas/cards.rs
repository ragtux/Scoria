//! What is drawn inside a card's frame.
//!
//! The view paints the frame (border, background, selection, the label
//! above a card and a group's title) itself and asks `Cards` for one element
//! per visible card, laid out with `layout_as_root` at the card's screen
//! size and clipped to the frame. `Cards` caches whatever is expensive to
//! build (a note's reading model, where an image lives) by node id, and
//! drops it when the node's content or the file it came from changes.
//!
//! A card's content is the reading view's: a text card's Markdown and a file
//! card's note go through the one parser (`reading::build_with`) and the one
//! block renderer (`reading::view::Renderer`), so a card shows exactly what
//! the reading view shows for the same text. Obsidian draws a card at a
//! fixed size and lets a CSS transform zoom it; gpui has no element
//! transform, so a card is instead rendered with every size multiplied by
//! the zoom: the font sizes through a scaled copy of the [`Theme`] and the
//! rem-based spacings through a scaled rem size ([`Scaled`]).
