//! The element that draws a `.pdf` open in a leaf, and the state behind it.
//!
//! The view is a toolbar over a column of pages, with a sidebar of
//! thumbnails or the table of contents on the left when it is open and a
//! find bar between the toolbar and the pages when that is. The pages are
//! laid out from their sizes alone — every page's box is exact before any
//! page is rendered — so the scroll extent is right from the first frame,
//! and only the pages in or near the viewport ask the [`documents`] cache
//! for an image; the rest are empty white boxes. Nothing here reads the
//! file: the cache does, on the background executor, and the view asks it
//! again every frame until the answer is there.
//!
//! What it draws is **observed**
//! (`tools/obsidian-probe/results/2026-10-26-pdf.json`, Obsidian 1.14.5,
//! written up in
//! [[Specification#Observed PDF view behavior, Obsidian 1.14.x]]): the
//! toolbar's six controls and their order, icons, sizes and spacing; the
//! two menus and their rows; pages stacked with no gap but their own 4 px
//! transparent border, centred, ringed by `--pdf-shadow`; the 140 px
//! sidebar showing thumbnails by default; the 42 px find bar and its
//! "1 of 3 matches"; `page-width` as the zoom on open, with the zoom
//! buttons stepping as pdf.js does; the leaf recording nothing but the
//! file; Left and Right as the page keys and the browser's own scrolling
//! keys; and a file that will not open showing the toolbar over nothing,
//! "of 0".
//!
//! The zoom vocabulary is pdf.js's, which is what the viewer is built on:
//! `page-width`, `page-fit` and a number, where `1` (100 %) is
//! [`CSS_UNITS`] logical pixels per point — pdf.js lays a page out at 96
//! dpi — and a step in or out multiplies by [`SCALE_DELTA`] and rounds to
//! a tenth, between [`MIN_SCALE`] and [`MAX_SCALE`]. The current page is
//! pdf.js's too: the page showing the most of itself, by area, unless the
//! page the view was on is still wholly in view.
//!
//! The view scrolls itself: the column sits at `-scroll` inside an
//! `overflow_hidden` box and the wheel, the keys and the page input move
//! it. That keeps the layout exact under a zoom change (the page under the
//! pointer, or at the top, stays put) and lets the socket read the scroll
//! back as plain numbers. Where the view was in a file is kept for the
//! session, per file, so a tab that comes back to it comes back to the
//! same page — Obsidian's leaf stays alive behind an inactive tab, and its
//! `workspace.json` never records a page, zoom or scroll. What was not
//! observed is marked `OBSERVE:` where the guess is made.
