//! An embedded PDF: `![[x.pdf]]` inside a note, and the file card a canvas
//! draws for one.
//!
//! Both draw the same thing, [`Pages`]: pdf.js's toolbar over a box that
//! scrolls the file's pages, at one zoom for the whole file, opened at the
//! page a `#page=` names. The note embed is that inside the embed's frame
//! ([`render`]), at the height `#height=` gives or the height that fits the
//! opened page; the canvas card is the same filling the card ([`render_card`]).
//!
//! **How the element reaches the document cache.** The reading renderer builds
//! elements with no `App` in hand, and a page's size is only known once
//! [`documents`] has parsed the file, so the drawing is two custom
//! [`Element`]s that do their work where gpui hands every element a `Window`
//! and an `App`. [`Frame`] asks the cache for the document in
//! `request_layout` — that is where the frame's height is decided, and an
//! unforced height is the opened page's — and wraps a plain `div` around
//! [`Pages`]. `Pages` lays the pages out in `prepaint`, where its bounds are
//! known, and builds the toolbar and the scroll box as ordinary elements laid
//! out as a root inside those bounds (`layout_as_root` + `prepaint_at`, the
//! way a canvas card is drawn inside its frame). The model carries nothing
//! but the path and the subpath; nothing here reads a file on the UI thread.
//!
//! Only the pages intersecting the box's viewport get an `img` — asking the
//! cache for a page is what starts its render — and the rest are empty boxes
//! of the page's size, so a 300-page file embedded in a note costs three
//! renders. The scroll offset and the zoom live in the element's state across
//! frames ([`State`]), which is also how the element reads where the box is
//! scrolled to when it decides which pages are visible (one frame behind the
//! wheel, which is one frame of an empty box at most).
//!
//! **Observed, Obsidian 1.14.5** (`tools/obsidian-probe/results/2026-10-26-pdf.json`,
//! steps `s08-embeds`, `s10-canvas`, `s14-small-broken`; the spec's prose
//! section was still being written when this was built, so the numbers are
//! cited from the run itself):
//!
//! - the embed is a box `width: 100%` with a hairline border in the border
//!   colour and a 4 px radius, no margin and no padding, `overflow: hidden`;
//!   its height is **800 px before the file loads** and then the toolbar
//!   plus the content: the opened page's fitted height when the link names
//!   none (455.88 for a landscape first page 591 px wide, 873.84 for
//!   `#page=3` on a portrait page), or `#height=` when it does (`#height=300`
//!   became 338 px in Live Preview) — [`PdfEmbed::frame_height`]. The
//!   `#page=2&height=200` embed still read 200 px, but it had not been laid
//!   out yet (a 0 × 0 rect), so it is taken as not yet resized rather than
//!   as a second rule;
//! - a page's drawn size is its points times the scale **rounded down to 2
//!   px** (pdf.js's `--scale-round`, in every `.page` style): the landscape
//!   first page was 590 × 416 at a scale that gives 591 × 417.9;
//! - it carries pdf.js's whole toolbar: sidebar toggle, sidebar options,
//!   zoom out, a divider, zoom in, display options, the page box and "of N",
//!   and "Open" on the right; the first page starts 39.37 px under the box's
//!   top (the toolbar plus its border, [`TOOLBAR_HEIGHT`]) with no gap above
//!   it, pages are 10 px apart ([`PAGE_GAP`]) and the last one ends the
//!   content; a page is left-flush at the full client width, and the client
//!   width is the box less the 12 px Obsidian's scrollbar takes
//!   ([`SCROLLBAR_WIDTH`]);
//! - the zoom is pdf.js's `page-width`, measured on the **opened** page:
//!   `591 / (841.89 pt × 4/3)` for the landscape first page, `591 / (595.28
//!   pt × 4/3)` for `#page=3`, so the other pages of a mixed file are
//!   narrower (centred) or wider (scrolled) at that one scale;
//! - a `#page=` embed opens with that page's top flush under the toolbar,
//!   and the canvas card for a `#page=2` node likewise (`scrollTop` 424.14,
//!   one page and a gap down);
//! - a broken file draws the toolbar with "0 of 0" and an empty box, and no
//!   message; a missing one is the shell's `file-embed mod-empty-attachment`
//!   box, which the reading view draws (`“missing.pdf” could not be found.`);
//! - the canvas card is the same toolbar and pages inside the card's frame,
//!   with the pages fitted to the card's width.
//!
//! **This build's reading** (`OBSERVE:` in the code): the viewer's ground
//! colour, what the toolbar's sidebar, options and display menus open (they
//! are drawn and inert here), typing into the page box (drawn, not editable),
//! what "Open" opens (a menu in Obsidian; the file here), whether anything
//! is drawn while the file loads, and the toolbar's exact text size.
