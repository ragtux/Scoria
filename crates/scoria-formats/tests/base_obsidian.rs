//! The base model against what Obsidian 1.14.5 wrote, observed over CDP on
//! 2026-10-25 (`tools/obsidian-probe/bases.mjs`, raw run in
//! `tools/obsidian-probe/results/2026-10-25-bases.json`). `scrambled.in.base`
//! under `tests/base` is the file the probe wrote into a scratch vault, and
//! `scrambled.out.base` beside it is what Obsidian wrote back when the view
//! was closed — 1352 bytes in, 1256 out, with nothing edited.
//!
//! There is no writer yet, so what these assert is the half the model owes it:
//! that the key order the model computes is the key order Obsidian wrote, read
//! back out of the observed bytes rather than copied from the prose. The
//! writer and its byte-for-byte gate are the next commit.
