//! `scoria-llm-mcp`: a Model Context Protocol server in front of a local
//! model, so bulk text work can be done off the caller's own token budget.
//!
//! This is the binary a user registers in `.mcp.json`:
//!
//! ```json
//! {"mcpServers": {"scoria-llm": {"command": "target/release/scoria-llm-mcp"}}}
//! ```
//!
//! The transport is stdio, so **stdout carries the protocol and nothing else**
//! — one JSON object per line. Every log line goes to stderr. The tools are in
//! [`tools`], the framing in [`rpc`], the model in [`model`], and [`http`] is
//! the small HTTP client that reaches it.
//!
//! The model is misco's `llama-server` router (`hosts/misco/llm.nix` in the
//! nix flake): one OpenAI-compatible endpoint serving five Qwen presets, which
//! it loads on demand. The wire format is OpenAI's `/v1/chat/completions`, so
//! any other such server works by changing one variable:
//!
//! ```sh
//! SCORIA_LLM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1                 # on misco (the default)
//! SCORIA_LLM_URL=http://misco.tail.ragtux.com:8080/v1     # from the tailnet
//! ```
//!
//! Configuration, all environment variables: `SCORIA_LLM_URL`,
//! `SCORIA_LLM_MODEL`, `SCORIA_LLM_KEY`, `SCORIA_LLM_TIMEOUT_MS`,
//! `SCORIA_LLM_MAX_BYTES`.
//!
//! Two properties of that router shape how these tools behave, and both belong
//! in the code rather than only in a note. It keeps **one** model resident
//! (`--models-max 1`), so naming a preset other than the loaded one evicts it
//! and costs a 10-30 s reload: pick one model for a run. And it sleeps an idle
//! model after 30 minutes, so the first call after a quiet afternoon pays that
//! reload as well — which is why the default timeout is minutes, not seconds.
//! A slow first call is the model waking, not a hang.
