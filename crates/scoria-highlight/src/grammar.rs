//! A Prism grammar, in Rust.
//!
//! Prism's grammars are plain JavaScript objects: an **ordered** map from a
//! token name to one pattern or a list of them, each a regex plus four
//! flags. The order is load-bearing — `comment` before `string` is why a
//! `//` inside a string is not a comment — so a `HashMap` would be wrong
//! here, and the entries keep the order they were written in.
//!
//! The flags are Prism's own:
//!
//! - [`LB`] (`lookbehind`) — not a regex lookbehind. The pattern's **first
//!   capture group** is context that must match but is not part of the
//!   token, which is how Prism writes a lookbehind without needing one.
//! - [`GR`] (`greedy`) — the pattern matches against the whole text rather
//!   than one unclaimed run, so it may reach across tokens already made.
//!   Strings and comments are greedy, which is how they win over what is
//!   inside them.
//! - `inside` — a grammar for the matched text, giving nested tokens.
//! - `alias` — extra class names after the type (`boolean important`).
//!
//! A grammar is written with the four constructors below, which are `const`
//! so a language is a `static` and costs nothing until it is used:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub static JSON: Grammar = Grammar::new(&[
//!     e("property", &[pf(&[STRING, r"(?=\s*:)"], LB | GR)]),
//!     e("number", &[p(&[r"-?\b\d+(?:\.\d+)?(?:e[+-]?\d+)?\b"])]),
//! ]);
//! ```
