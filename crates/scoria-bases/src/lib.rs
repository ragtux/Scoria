//! The Bases expression language.
//!
//! A `.base` holds statements — filters, formulas, summaries — as strings, and
//! this crate turns one into the tree Obsidian parses it into and evaluates
//! that tree against a row. Everything here is observed rather than inferred:
//! see
//! [[Specification#Observed Bases expression language, Obsidian 1.14.5 (installer build 1.13.7)]],
//! whose precedence table was read off real parse trees rather than deduced
//! from values, and whose function table was read two ways that agreed.
//!
//! This crate has **no printer**, deliberately. Obsidian keeps a statement's
//! original text beside its tree and writes the text back, so `scoria-formats`
//! holds statements verbatim and never needs a tree to write one. Nothing in
//! the crate graph lets it: `scoria-formats` does not depend on this crate and
//! must not, or a writer could route a statement through an AST and lose the
//! bytes.
//!
//! Evaluation reads no vault. The host implements [`Context`] and fills in a
//! [`FileData`] per row, so the crate stays free of `scoria-vault` and of
//! gpui.
