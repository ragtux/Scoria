//! Writing a block id into the note a block reference points at.
//!
//! Accepting a block row whose block carries no id of its own means writing
//! one into the *target* note. Obsidian does it in exactly two shapes — a
//! block whose text ends a line takes the id inline, a block that spans
//! lines takes it on a line of its own with a blank line either side — and
//! both were observed byte for byte: see
//! [[Specification#Observed block reference behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4]].
//!
//! The planning here is over the target's **raw bytes**, never through the
//! editor's text model, so a file's own line endings and byte order mark
//! survive a write to a note nobody has open.
