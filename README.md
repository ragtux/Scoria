# Scoria

Scoria is a native knowledge base written in Rust on [GPUI](https://gpui.rs), built to open
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vaults unchanged: same folder, same `.obsidian` configuration,
same Markdown dialect, same `.canvas` and `.base` files. It is an independent implementation
and is not affiliated with Obsidian.

## Status

Reader done, Writer in progress. `scoria-markdown` parses CommonMark (all 652 spec examples), the
GitHub extensions Obsidian uses, and Obsidian's own syntax into one tree with byte spans, and renders
it to reading-view HTML that matches Obsidian 1.13.7 on 1007 of 1009 corpus notes; the metadata
cache, the editor and the link rewriter are all built from that tree. The application opens a real
vault with the three-pane shell: Files, reading view, Backlinks, Outgoing links, Outline, Tags,
Search, the quick switcher, the graph, the command palette and a read-only Settings modal. Notes
open in Live Preview or Source mode with find and replace, multiple cursors and autosave; new note,
rename, move, copy and delete rewrite links the way Obsidian does. Everything is bound through
Obsidian's command ids, so a vault's `hotkeys.json` applies unchanged.

```
cargo run --release -p scoria -- "C:\path\to\your\vault"
cargo run --release -p scoria -- docs/scoria --synthetic 50000 --stress   # editor spike with a report
cargo test --workspace
```

## Compatibility tiers

| Tier | Goal | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Vault and format compatibility (no conversion, no data loss) | In scope, first |
| 2 | Core feature parity with Obsidian's app and 35 core plugins | In scope |
| 3 | Theme compatibility | Variable-level subset of the 1047 CSS custom properties |
| 4 | Community plugin compatibility | New native plugin API; existing JS plugins are out of scope |

The full functional specification this project implements, derived from observing Obsidian 1.12.7's
behavior, file formats, and public documentation, lives in the `docs/scoria` vault and is published
at [scoria.ragtux.com](https://scoria.ragtux.com).

## Crates

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `scoria` | GPUI application: window, workspace shell, views |
| `scoria-vault` | A vault is a folder: scanning, file kinds, `.obsidian` config reads |
| `scoria-markdown` | Obsidian Flavored Markdown: CommonMark + GFM + Obsidian syntax parsed into one spanned tree, HTML renderer |
| `scoria-cache` | Metadata cache (`CachedMetadata`) and link resolution with Obsidian's rules |
| `scoria-formats` | On-disk formats: file kinds, `app.json` and friends, JSON Canvas 1.0, Bases YAML |
| `scoria-commands` | The 196 command ids and default hotkeys so vault `hotkeys.json` applies unchanged |

## Roadmap

| Phase | Gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Spike | 50k-line editor, parser conformance corpus, 2 s vault index | Done |
| 2. Reader | A daily user browses their real vault with no missing content | Done: Files, reading view, Backlinks, Outgoing links, Outline, Tags, Search, quick switcher, graph, command palette, read-only Settings, file watching |
| 3. Writer | The vault round-trips byte-identical after a week of mixed use in both apps | In progress: Source mode, Live Preview, find and replace, file operations with link rewriting are done; table editing, properties, autocompletion, templates, daily notes, file recovery and writing settings back are next |
| 4. Parity | Core plugin parity | Not started: canvas, bases, PDF, math, themes subset, URI and CLI |
| 5. Ecosystem | Native plugin SDK | Not started |

Progress notes, gates and the per-item status live in `docs/scoria/Development.md`.

## Releases

Pushing a `v*` tag builds the `scoria` binary on both forges and attaches the archives with a
`SHA256SUMS` file:

- [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ragtux/scoria/releases) — Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64, macOS arm64
- [git.ragtux.com releases](https://git.ragtux.com/ragtux/scoria/releases) — Linux x86_64

There is no installer: unpack the archive and run `scoria /path/to/vault`. The binaries are
unsigned, and only the Linux build has been run on a real GPU — see `docs/scoria/Development.md`.
