# Coming from Obsidian

There is no migration. Scoria opens the folder Obsidian already opens, reads the same
`.obsidian` configuration, and leaves everything where it is. You can open a vault in
Scoria this afternoon and in Obsidian this evening, and neither will notice.

What follows is what to expect.

## What carries over, with no work

| Your | In Scoria |
|---|---|
| Notes | Read as they are. Same files, same names, same folders |
| Wikilinks, embeds, aliases | Resolved by Obsidian's rules, including the ambiguous-basename order |
| Tags | Merged from inline `#tags` and the `tags` property, case-insensitively |
| Frontmatter | Parsed, shown as properties in reading view, and its links counted as links |
| Attachments | Images, audio, video and PDFs are recognized and shown in Files |
| `hotkeys.json` | Applied command by command. Your bindings are your bindings |
| `appearance.json` | Base theme, accent color, fonts and font size are read before the window opens |
| `graph.json` | Filters, color groups, display settings and forces drive the graph view |
| `core-plugins.json`, `community-plugins.json` | Read and shown in Settings (community plugins are listed, not run) |
| `app.json` settings | The editor and files settings are honored, and Settings writes them back — see [settings](/docs/settings/) |
| `bookmarks.json` | Read into the Bookmarks pane and written back in Obsidian's bytes |
| `workspace.json` | The `main` tree of tab groups and the panes' own leaf state are read at restore and written back in place |
| Canvas files | Opened in a canvas view and saved in Obsidian's bytes |
| Bases files | Recognized, parsed and round-tripped on disk, but **not drawn yet** |

## What you will miss

Be realistic about this list before you make Scoria your daily reader.

- **Community plugins.** They are JavaScript against an Electron app; Scoria is a native
  binary. They cannot run, and making them run is out of scope. If your workflow rests on
  Dataview or Templater, Scoria is not yet a place you can work.
- **Themes.** `appearance.json`'s base theme and accent color are honored, but a CSS theme
  is not. A variable-level subset of Obsidian's CSS custom properties is a later phase.
- **Rendered math.** `$x$` and `$$x$$` are parsed and show as their source text, not as
  typeset math.
- **HTML in notes.** Shown as text rather than rendered.
- **Remote images.** A `![](https://…)` does not load; local images do.
- **The Bases view.** The Bases YAML format is implemented and round-trips; a `.base` does
  not open. A `.canvas` does, in a canvas view of its own.
- **A few settings controls.** Most rows write; the font pickers, spellcheck languages,
  excluded files, accent color and the theme list do not.
- **Popout windows and multiple vaults in one window**, PDF export, heading folding,
  drag-and-drop in Files, inline title editing, pasting attachments.

The full list, kept honest, is [what differs from
Obsidian](/docs/reference/differences/).

## Trying it without risk

The safe order, in increasing commitment:

1. **Read-only, on your real vault.** Open it in Scoria and browse. Browsing writes no note
   and no cache; the one file it can touch is `.obsidian/workspace.json`, on the way out and
   only if the session changed the layout, with every key Scoria does not know about carried
   through. There is no risk to a note here beyond the program crashing, which loses
   nothing.

2. **Edit a scratch copy.** Copy a dozen notes into a new folder, including a couple with
   frontmatter, tables and CRLF line endings if you have them. Edit them in Scoria, then
   open the folder in Obsidian and look for anything that changed that you did not change.
   That is exactly the round-trip check Scoria's own phase-3 gate makes.

3. **Edit for real, with a backup.** A git repository in the vault is the ideal form of
   this: `git diff` after an editing session tells you precisely what Scoria wrote, which is
   both a safety net and the most useful bug report you can send.

> **Warning** Until the round-trip gate is met, treat Scoria as a reader on a vault you
> cannot afford to lose, and as an editor on a vault you can.

## Running both on one folder

This works, and it is how the project itself is developed — Scoria's own specification
vault is edited in both apps. Two things to know:

- **Scoria watches the folder.** A save in Obsidian re-indexes in Scoria within a moment,
  and the open note reloads keeping its scroll position. You do not need to reopen anything.
- **Do not have the same note unsaved in both.** Obsidian and Scoria both autosave, and
  whichever writes last wins. Scoria will not overwrite a note that changed on disk while
  you have unsaved edits in it — it leaves your buffer alone — but then you have two
  versions and have to pick. The habit that avoids it is the ordinary one: edit a note in
  one place at a time.

Running both at once is also the best way to find bugs. If the two apps disagree about how
a note renders or where a link points, that is a real defect and worth
[reporting](https://github.com/ragtux/scoria/issues).

## Things that will feel different

Not bugs, just differences you will notice in the first ten minutes:

- **It starts immediately.** There is no splash: the vault is scanned on a background
  thread while the window is already up.
- **One window, one vault.** Run it twice for two vaults. Popout windows do not exist here.
- **Tabs and splits, but no stacked tabs.** `Ctrl + T` opens a tab, Split right and Split
  down divide the main area into groups, a tab drags between them, and `Ctrl + Alt + ←` /
  `→` still walk the history of what you have opened.
- **Settings writes one key at a time.** Obsidian re-serialises a settings file on every
  change; Scoria merges the key you changed into the file's own JSON and leaves the rest of
  the bytes alone.
