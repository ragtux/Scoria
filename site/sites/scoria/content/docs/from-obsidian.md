title: Coming from Obsidian
description: What carries over from Obsidian to Scoria, what you will miss, how to try Scoria on a vault you care about without risking it, and how to run both apps on the same folder.

# Coming from Obsidian

There is no migration. Scoria opens the folder Obsidian already opens, reads the same
`.obsidian` configuration, and leaves everything where it is. You can open a vault in
Scoria this afternoon and in Obsidian this evening, and neither will notice.

What follows is what to expect.

## What carries over, with no work

| Your | In Scoria |
|---|---|
| Notes | Read as they are. Same files, same names, same folders |
| Wikilinks, embeds, aliases | Resolved by Obsidian's rules, including the ambiguous-basename order |
| Tags | Merged from inline `#tags` and the `tags` property, case-insensitively |
| Frontmatter | Parsed, shown as properties in reading view, and its links counted as links |
| Attachments | Images, audio, video and PDFs are recognized and shown in Files |
| `hotkeys.json` | Applied command by command. Your bindings are your bindings |
| `appearance.json` | Base theme, accent color, fonts and font size are read before the window opens |
| `graph.json` | Filters, color groups, display settings and forces drive the graph view |
| `core-plugins.json`, `community-plugins.json` | Read and shown in Settings (community plugins are listed, not run) |
| `app.json` settings | The editor and files settings are honored — see [settings](/docs/settings/) |
| Canvas and Bases files | Recognized, parsed and round-tripped on disk, but **not drawn yet** |

## What you will miss

Be realistic about this list before you make Scoria your daily reader.

- **Community plugins.** They are JavaScript against an Electron app; Scoria is a native
  binary. They cannot run, and making them run is out of scope. If your workflow rests on
  Dataview or Templater, Scoria is not yet a place you can work.
- **Themes.** `appearance.json`'s base theme and accent color are honored, but a CSS theme
  is not. A variable-level subset of Obsidian's CSS custom properties is a later phase.
- **Rendered math.** `$x$` and `$$x$$` are parsed and show as their source text, not as
  typeset math.
- **HTML in notes.** Shown as text rather than rendered.
- **Remote images.** A `![](https://…)` does not load; local images do.
- **Canvas and Bases views.** The formats are implemented, the views are not.
- **Changing settings in the app.** Settings shows your real configuration and is read-only.
- **Tabs and split panes.** One note at a time, with back and forward history.
- **Multiple vaults in one window**, PDF export, heading folding, drag-and-drop in Files,
  inline title editing, pasting attachments.

The full list, kept honest, is [what differs from
Obsidian](/docs/reference/differences/).

## Trying it without risk

The safe order, in increasing commitment:

1. **Read-only, on your real vault.** Open it in Scoria and browse. Reading writes nothing
   at all — not a cache, not a settings file, not `workspace.json`. There is no risk here
   beyond the program crashing, which loses nothing.

2. **Edit a scratch copy.** Copy a dozen notes into a new folder, including a couple with
   frontmatter, tables and CRLF line endings if you have them. Edit them in Scoria, then
   open the folder in Obsidian and look for anything that changed that you did not change.
   That is exactly the round-trip check Scoria's own phase-3 gate makes.

3. **Edit for real, with a backup.** A git repository in the vault is the ideal form of
   this: `git diff` after an editing session tells you precisely what Scoria wrote, which is
   both a safety net and the most useful bug report you can send.

> **Warning** Until the round-trip gate is met, treat Scoria as a reader on a vault you
> cannot afford to lose, and as an editor on a vault you can.

## Running both on one folder

This works, and it is how the project itself is developed — Scoria's own specification
vault is edited in both apps. Two things to know:

- **Scoria watches the folder.** A save in Obsidian re-indexes in Scoria within a moment,
  and the open note reloads keeping its scroll position. You do not need to reopen anything.
- **Do not have the same note unsaved in both.** Obsidian and Scoria both autosave, and
  whichever writes last wins. Scoria will not overwrite a note that changed on disk while
  you have unsaved edits in it — it leaves your buffer alone — but then you have two
  versions and have to pick. The habit that avoids it is the ordinary one: edit a note in
  one place at a time.

Running both at once is also the best way to find bugs. If the two apps disagree about how
a note renders or where a link points, that is a real defect and worth
[reporting](https://github.com/ragtux/scoria/issues).

## Things that will feel different

Not bugs, just differences you will notice in the first ten minutes:

- **It starts immediately.** There is no splash and no window-restore step, because the
  layout is not restored — Scoria opens its own default three-pane shell every time.
- **One window, one vault.** Run it twice for two vaults.
- **There are no tabs.** One note is open at a time, and `Ctrl + Alt + ←` / `→` walk the
  history of what you have opened. Split panes, stacked tabs and popout windows do not
  exist here.
- **Settings is a window you read.** Every value is your real value, pulled from
  `.obsidian`; none of them are editable yet. To change a setting, change it in Obsidian or
  edit the JSON.
