title: What Scoria is
description: Scoria is a native Rust knowledge base that opens Obsidian vaults unchanged — what that means in practice, what it deliberately is not, and who it is for.

# What Scoria is

Scoria is a desktop application that opens a folder of Markdown files and lets you read,
search, link and edit them. It is written in Rust, its interface is [GPUI](https://gpui.rs),
and it is free software under the MIT license.

What makes it different from the many other Markdown editors is the compatibility target:
**Scoria opens an Obsidian vault exactly as it stands.** The same folder, the same
`.obsidian` configuration, the same Markdown dialect, the same `.canvas` and `.base` files,
the same `hotkeys.json`. There is no import, no export, no conversion step and no second
copy of your notes in a database somewhere.

## The promise, stated precisely

Three rules shape the whole program, and they are worth stating because they are what you
are actually relying on:

1. **The vault folder is the only source of truth.** Scoria has no database, no index file
   it depends on, no sidecar metadata. Everything it knows, it knows by reading your files.
   Delete Scoria and the vault is untouched.

2. **It never writes a file it did not change.** Opening a vault writes nothing. Browsing
   writes nothing. Reading your settings writes nothing — Settings is deliberately
   read-only at present, because Obsidian rewrites an entire settings file on every change
   and that is a thing to get right rather than quickly.

3. **When it does write, it changes only what you changed.** A file's byte-order mark and
   its line endings are remembered at load and restored on save. Unknown keys in a JSON or
   YAML file are carried through rather than dropped. A rename rewrites the links that point
   at the renamed file and leaves every other byte of those notes alone.

## What it is not

- **It is not Obsidian, and it is not affiliated with Obsidian.** It is an independent
  implementation that reads the same files. Obsidian is a trademark of Dynalist Inc.
- **It is not a fork or a repackaging.** No code, CSS or icons come from Obsidian's bundle.
  The behavior was written down as a specification first, from observing a real Obsidian and
  reading its public documentation, and the code implements that document.
- **It is not a plugin host for Obsidian's community plugins.** Those are JavaScript written
  against an Electron application. Scoria is a native binary; they cannot run in it, and
  making them run is explicitly out of scope. A native plugin interface of Scoria's own is
  planned instead.
- **It is not a sync service.** There is no Scoria account and no Scoria server. Use git,
  Syncthing, a file-sync service, or Obsidian Sync — they all move files, and files are all
  Scoria needs.
- **It is not finished.** See [what differs from Obsidian](/docs/reference/differences/).

## Why it exists

Obsidian's vault format is a good format: plain files in a plain folder, readable in any
editor, with a well-understood Markdown dialect layered on it. That format deserves more
than one implementation — because an implementation can stop being maintained, change its
terms, or simply not be the program you want, and a format with one reader is only as
durable as that reader.

The practical reasons are more ordinary. A native application starts in a fraction of a
second, scrolls a 50,000-line note inside a frame budget, holds a 20,000-note vault in a
few hundred megabytes, and does not ship a browser engine to render a text file. If you
live in your notes, that difference is felt hourly.

## Who it is for, today

At version 0.1.0, honestly:

- **Good fit now:** reading and searching a vault you maintain in Obsidian; browsing a large
  vault where a native reader is simply nicer; anyone who wants a second implementation to
  exist and is willing to file bugs against one.
- **Workable with care:** editing notes, with a backup and preferably after a round-trip
  test on a scratch copy. The editor is real — Live Preview, Source mode, find and replace,
  multiple cursors, link-rewriting renames — but it is the newest code in the project.
- **Not yet:** anyone who needs Canvas, Bases, rendered math, community plugins, themes, or
  settings they can change from inside the app.

## Where to go next

- [Install and run](/docs/install/) — get a binary and start it.
- [Open a vault](/docs/open-a-vault/) — what happens the first time.
- [Coming from Obsidian](/docs/from-obsidian/) — what carries over, and how to try it safely.
- [Obsidian compatibility](/docs/reference/compatibility/) — the four tiers and the numbers.
