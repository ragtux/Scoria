# Tables, code and math

## Tables

```markdown
| Option | Default | What it does      |
|--------|:-------:|------------------:|
| `a`    |   on    | something         |
| `b`    |   off   | something else    |
```

Alignment comes from the delimiter row: `:---` left, `:---:` centre, `---:` right.

**A `|` inside a code span does not split a cell.** This is the GitHub rule and Obsidian
follows it, so you can write `` `a|b` `` in a cell. To write a literal pipe outside code,
escape it: `\|`. That is also why a wikilink alias inside a table is written
`[[Note\|alias]]`.

Three structural rules decide whether you have a table at all:

- The header row must be a **one-line paragraph** followed immediately by the delimiter row.
- The header row **or** the delimiter row must contain a pipe.
- A table **cannot interrupt a longer paragraph**, and a row line with no pipe ends the
  table.

### How columns are sized

In reading view, columns follow HTML's automatic table layout, measured with the real font:
each column wants its widest cell, needs at least its longest unbreakable word, and when the
total does not fit, the slack is shared out in proportion. See [reading
view](/docs/app/reading-view/).

### Editing a table

In Live Preview a table stays a grid wherever the cursor is, the way Obsidian's table editor
does. Click a cell to open a field in it: `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` walk the cells, `Enter`
drops into the cell below, `Escape` abandons, and the column grows with what is typed.
Committing a cell replaces that cell's bytes and nothing else — ordinary typing re-pads
nothing, which is what Obsidian does too. A `|` typed into a cell is written `\|` and a
newline becomes a space, because either would otherwise restructure the table. In Source
mode you edit the pipes directly.

Obsidian's sixteen table commands are all here — add, move, duplicate and delete rows and
columns, set a column's alignment, insert a table — and, like Obsidian's, they are offered
only while the cursor is in a table. Each **rewrites the whole table**: every cell padded to
its column's width, outer pipes added, short rows filled out, the delimiter grown to match.
That is Obsidian's behavior, byte for byte, and one undo step takes it back.

> **Note** The table under the cursor comes from the one Markdown parser rather than from

> one in reading view. One consequence: `` | `a|b` | **bold** | `` is a paragraph by GFM's
> rules, and Scoria leaves it as prose where Obsidian's table editor would rewrite it into a
> three-column table.

## Code

Inline code is backticks: `` `like this` ``. A backtick run with no closer retries one
backtick shorter, so a stray triple backtick does not swallow the rest of the line.

Fenced blocks take a language label:

````markdown
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("hello");
}
```
````

The label is shown on the block in reading view. **Code never wraps** — a long line scrolls
sideways inside its own block, which is almost always what you want for code and is what
Obsidian does.

Nothing inside a code span or a fenced block is parsed as anything else: no wikilinks, no
tags, no math, and a rename never rewrites a link that appears in code.

## Math

```markdown
Inline: $e^{i\pi} = -1$

Block:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \tfrac{1}{3}
$$
```

> **Warning** Math is **parsed but not typeset**. In reading view you see the formula's
> source text, not rendered mathematics. In Live Preview the surrounding dollar signs are
> hidden. MathJax is a later phase.

The delimiter rules are Obsidian's, and they are stricter than you might expect:

- `$...$` needs **no space** just inside the dollars, and the closing `$` must not be
  followed by a digit. That is what stops `$5 and $7` from becoming math.
- An unterminated `$$` block runs to the **end of the file**.
- `$$x$$` opened and closed on one line stays **inline** inside its paragraph.

## Comments

```markdown
Visible text %%hidden%% more visible text.

%%
A whole block that does not render.
%%
```

`%%…%%` hides text in both reading view and Live Preview.

- An **inline** `%%comment%%` does **not** cross a line break.
- An unterminated `%%` block runs to the end of the file, like `$$`.
- `%%x%%` closed on one line stays inline.
