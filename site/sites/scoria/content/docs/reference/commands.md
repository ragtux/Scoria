# Commands and hotkeys

Scoria registers **244 command ids** — the exact strings Obsidian registers, so your
`hotkeys.json` matches them — of which **227 have an observed desktop name**. **41** carry a
default hotkey. **127** do something in Scoria today.

Those four numbers are different things and the difference is the point:

- An **id** is what your `hotkeys.json` keys on. Registering all of them is why your
  bindings survive opening the vault in Scoria.
- A **name** is what the command palette and the Hotkeys tab display.
- A **default hotkey** is Obsidian's binding, applied unless your file overrides it.
- **Runnable** means Scoria implements the behavior. The [command
  palette](/docs/app/switcher/) offers only these; the [Hotkeys tab](/docs/hotkeys/) lists
  all 244, so you can see your bindings for everything else.

Some of the 127 are runnable only in the right place, which is also how Obsidian treats
them: **37** need an editor on screen with the keyboard in it, so they leave the palette in
a reading leaf, and the **fifteen table commands** that act on an existing table are offered
only while the cursor is in one. `graph:open-local` is not offered with no file open. The palette, the hotkey and the
control socket all ask the same question, so a command that is listed is a command that
runs.

Ids come from Obsidian 1.12.7; names and default hotkeys were captured from Obsidian 1.14.4
with a throwaway plugin that dumped `app.commands` and the settings tabs.

## Commands with a default hotkey

`Ctrl` is Cmd on macOS, except where Obsidian itself registers a literal `Ctrl` — the tab
commands below, which are `Ctrl` everywhere.

> **Note** The two dashes are the two window commands: a popout window and a second window
> do not exist here. Their ids are registered and your bindings for them are kept.

## Runnable commands with no default key

These do something, and Obsidian ships no binding for them — so if you want a key, bind one
in `hotkeys.json`. Several are worth binding on day one: `editor:toggle-source`,
`graph:open-local`, and the two split commands.

## Keys that are not commands

A few keys belong to a widget rather than to the command registry, and are not rebindable:

| Key | Where | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `Ctrl + Q` | Anywhere | Quits |
| `Escape` | A modal or the find panel | Closes it |
| `Enter`, `↑`, `↓` | The switcher or palette | Choose and move |
| `Enter`, `↑`, `↓` | The find panel | Next and previous match |
| `Alt + Enter` | The find panel | *Find all* — a cursor at every match |
| `Alt + click` | The editor | Add or remove a cursor |
| `Ctrl + click` | Source mode | Follow a link |
| `Ctrl + 0` | The graph | Refit the view |

## The full id list

All 244 ids live in `crates/scoria-commands/data/commands.txt` in the repository, and the
names in `data/names.txt` beside it. Settings' [Hotkeys tab](/docs/hotkeys/) shows the same
list with your own bindings applied, which is usually the faster way to look one up.
