# What differs from Obsidian

Three kinds of difference, kept apart because they mean different things: **not yet**,
**deliberately different**, and **not ever**.

If you are deciding whether Scoria can be your daily editor, this is the page to read.

## Not yet

Things Obsidian does that Scoria intends to do and does not.

### Rendering

| | |
|---|---|
| **Math** | `$x$` and `$$x$$` are parsed but **not typeset** — you see the TeX source. In Live Preview the dollars are hidden and the source is centred in the accent color |
| **HTML in notes** | Parsed, shown as literal text |
| **Remote images** | `![](https://…)` does not load. Local images do |
| **Mermaid diagrams** | Not rendered |
| **PDF viewing and export** | PDFs are recognized as a file kind; there is no viewer and no export |
| **Audio and video players** | Recognized as file kinds; no player |
| **Heading folding** | Headings do not collapse |
| **Code block copy buttons** | Select and copy |
| **Toggling a task in reading view** | Checkboxes render but are inert there. They toggle in Live Preview |

### Views

| | |
|---|---|
| **Canvas** | The JSON Canvas 1.0 format is implemented and round-trips; there is no canvas view |
| **Bases** | The Bases YAML format is implemented and round-trips; there is no base view |
| **Tabs and split panes** | One note at a time, with back and forward history |
| **Popout windows** | — |
| **Multiple vaults in one window** | Run Scoria once per vault |
| **Local graph depth beyond 1**, arrows, timelapse, screenshot export | See [the graph](/docs/app/graph/) |
| **Local graph as a side pane** | The graph is a full view |

### Editing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Table cell editing** | A table is a widget in Live Preview; edit the Markdown as text |
| **Properties editor** | Frontmatter is YAML text |
| **Autocompletion** | No suggestions when you type `[[`, `#` or `![[` |
| **Auto-pairing** | `autoPairBrackets` and `autoPairMarkdown` are read, not acted on |
| **Bold/italic toggles** | `Ctrl + B` and `Ctrl + I` are registered ids with no behavior — type the asterisks |
| **Templates, daily notes, file recovery** | — |
| **Vim mode** | `vimMode` is read, not implemented |
| **Line numbers, indent guides, inline title, right-to-left** | Read and shown in Settings, not acted on |
| **Spellcheck** | — |
| **`Ctrl + hover` page previews** | — |

### Files and settings

| | |
|---|---|
| **Writing settings** | [Settings is read-only](/docs/settings/). Change settings in Obsidian or edit the JSON |
| **Writing `graph.json`** | Graph forces and filters are read, not written back |
| **Drag and drop in Files** | Use `file-explorer:move-file` |
| **Inline title editing** | Use `F2` |
| **Pasting or dropping attachments** | Put the file in the folder yourself |
| **System trash on Windows and macOS** | Implemented on Linux (freedesktop trash with a `.trashinfo` record); elsewhere it falls back to the vault's `.trash/` |
| **Themes (`cssTheme`)** | Base theme, accent color and fonts are honored; a CSS theme is not. Tier 3 |
| **Workspace layout** | `workspace.json` is read but not applied; Scoria opens its own default layout and never writes the file |
| **Search result context menu** | Sorting, copying, collapsing and the keyboard are in; a result has no right-click menu yet. See [search](/docs/app/search/) |
| **Vault-wide search and replace** | Replace works within one note |

### Markdown edge cases

Two of the 1,009 corpus notes do not match Obsidian's output, on three constructs: nested
delimiter runs such as `****a****`, `==== four ==x===y==`, and a wikilink inside Markdown
link text (which Obsidian splits the link on). See [compatibility](/docs/reference/compatibility/).

## Deliberately different

Places where Scoria does not copy Obsidian, on purpose.

**Frontmatter links are rewritten in place.** When a rename changes a link in your YAML,
Obsidian re-serialises the whole frontmatter block — which can turn `aliases: [Bee]` into a
block list, changing bytes you did not touch. Scoria replaces the link text and leaves every
other byte alone. This is a difference in Scoria's favor and it is not going to be
"fixed".

**Settings is read-only.** Not an omission so much as a sequencing choice: Obsidian rewrites
an entire settings file on every change, and doing that without dropping keys Scoria does not
recognize is exactly the kind of thing the round-trip gate exists to guarantee. Writing
settings comes after that gate, not before it.

**The command palette lists only runnable commands.** This matches how Obsidian hides a
command whose check callback fails, but the effect is more visible here because more commands
are unimplemented. The [Hotkeys tab](/docs/hotkeys/) still lists all 244 ids so your
bindings are visible.

**No window-layout restore.** Scoria opens its own three-pane layout every time, which is
also why it starts instantly.

**The default font is Liberation Sans.** Not a taste decision: the pinned GPUI cannot select
weights from a variable font, so with a single-file variable font nothing renders bold.
Liberation Sans ships static Bold faces. Your `appearance.json` fonts override it.

## Not ever

**Obsidian's community plugins will not run in Scoria.** They are JavaScript against an
Electron app's API, with Node and DOM access. Scoria is a native binary with neither.
Embedding a JavaScript runtime and a DOM to host them would rebuild the thing whose absence
is the entire point of the project.

What is planned instead is a **native plugin API of Scoria's own** (tier 4, the last phase).
Your `community-plugins.json` and plugin manifests are read and listed in Settings, so you can
see what your vault has — they are simply not executed.

**Obsidian Sync, Publish and the commercial services** are Obsidian's products, not file
formats. Scoria has nothing to do with them. Use any file-level sync — git, Syncthing,
Dropbox, or Obsidian Sync itself: they all move files, and files are all Scoria needs.

## Keeping this page honest

This list is maintained against `docs/scoria/Development.md` in the repository, which carries
the per-item status and the gate notes. If you find something missing from it — a difference
you hit that is not written here — that is worth
[reporting](https://github.com/ragtux/scoria/issues) in its own right.
