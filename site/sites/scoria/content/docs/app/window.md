# The window

Scoria opens one window on one vault, in a three-part shell: a dock on the left, the open
note in the middle, a dock on the right. Both docks can be hidden, which leaves the note
alone on screen.

## The left dock

Two tabs:

- **[Files](/docs/app/files/)** — the folder tree of the vault. The tab Scoria opens on.
- **[Search](/docs/app/search/)** — vault-wide search with the full query grammar.

`Ctrl + Shift + F` opens Search; `file-explorer:open` returns to Files. `Ctrl + E` is not
involved — toggling the dock itself is `app:toggle-left-sidebar`.

## The note

The middle is one note, in one of three modes:

| Mode | What it is | Switch with |
|---|---|---|
| Reading view | The finished note, rendered | `Ctrl + E` (`markdown:toggle-preview`) |
| Live Preview | Editing, with syntax hidden unless the cursor is in it | `Ctrl + E` from reading view |
| Source mode | Editing, with every marker visible | `editor:toggle-source` |

Which one a note opens in follows your vault's settings: `defaultViewMode` decides reading
view or editing, and `livePreview` decides which of the two editing modes. See [editing a
note](/docs/app/editing/).

> **Note** There are no tabs and no split panes. One note is open at a time.

## The right dock

Four tabs, all about the open note except Tags, which is about the whole vault:

- **[Backlinks](/docs/app/panes/)** — notes that link here, and unlinked mentions of this
  note's name or aliases.
- **[Outgoing links](/docs/app/panes/)** — where this note points, resolved and unresolved.
- **[Outline](/docs/app/panes/)** — this note's headings; click one to scroll to it.
- **[Tags](/docs/app/panes/)** — every tag in the vault with its count.

`app:toggle-right-sidebar` hides and shows the dock. Each tab also has a command of its own
(`backlink:open`, `outgoing-links:open`, `outline:open`, `tag-pane:open`), so you can bind a
key straight to the pane you want.

## The status bar

Along the bottom: the vault's status on the left, and the open note's word and character
count on the right. While you are editing, the right-hand side also carries the cursor's
line and column, the number of cursors when there is more than one, and the parser and
shaping timings for the note you are in:

```
Ln 212, Col 7  ·  parse 18.4 ms, 9120 spans  ·  shape 0.21 ms  ·  412 words, 2310 characters
```

Those timings are there on purpose rather than left in a debug build: the editor reparses
the note in the background after each edit, and this is where you can see that it is keeping
up. See [performance](/docs/reference/performance/).

## Navigating

| To | Do |
|---|---|
| Open a note | Click it in Files, or click a link in a note |
| Find a note by name | `Ctrl + O` — the [quick switcher](/docs/app/switcher/) |
| Run anything by name | `Ctrl + P` — the [command palette](/docs/app/switcher/) |
| Go back / forward | `Ctrl + Alt + ←` / `Ctrl + Alt + →` |
| Jump to a heading | Click it in Outline, or follow a `[[Note#Heading]]` link |
| See the vault's shape | `Ctrl + G` — the [graph](/docs/app/graph/) |
| Open Settings | `Ctrl + ,` |

Clicking a link to a note that does not exist creates it — the same as Obsidian, and the
same as pressing Enter in the quick switcher on a name nothing matches. See [managing
notes](/docs/app/manage/).

History is per window and linear: opening a note from the graph, from a link, from Files or
from the switcher all push onto the same back stack.

## Keys

Every shortcut in Scoria is an Obsidian command bound from its default hotkey, so your
vault's `hotkeys.json` rebinds or unbinds all of them. The one exception is `Ctrl + Q`,
which quits.

The 34 commands Scoria can actually run are the ones the command palette offers; the rest
are still listed in Settings' Hotkeys tab, so you can see your bindings for commands that
do not do anything yet. The full list is in [commands and
hotkeys](/docs/reference/commands/).

## The theme

Colors come from your vault's `appearance.json` — the base theme (dark or light) and the
accent color — and are read before the window opens, so the first frame is already right.
A CSS theme (`cssTheme`) is not applied; that is a later phase.

Fonts come from `appearance.json` too: the interface font, the text font and the monospace
font, with the font size.

> **Note** The default text and interface font is Liberation Sans rather than something more
> modern, because the pinned GPUI cannot pick weights out of a variable font — with a
> single-file variable font, nothing renders bold. Set `textFontFamily` and
> `interfaceFontFamily` in `appearance.json` to any font with real static Bold faces and it
> is honored.
