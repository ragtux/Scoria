# Reading view

Reading view is the note as a finished document: no markers, no cursor, links you click.
`Ctrl + E` (`markdown:toggle-preview`) toggles between it and editing.

Whether a note opens here depends on your vault: `defaultViewMode` in `app.json` is either
`preview` (reading view) or editing, and Scoria follows it.

## What is rendered

Everything in this list is drawn from the same parse tree the editor and the metadata cache
use, so what you read and what the cache believes cannot disagree.

| | |
|---|---|
| Headings | Levels 1–6, scaled |
| Paragraphs | With soft line breaks — a single newline is a `<br>` unless `strictLineBreaks` is on |
| Emphasis | `*italic*`, `**bold**`, `~~strike~~`, `==highlight==` |
| Inline code | With the monospace font |
| Links | `[[Wikilinks]]`, Markdown links, and bare URLs — all clickable |
| Tags | Clickable, and counted in the Tags pane |
| Images | Local files, with Obsidian's size hints: `![[pic.png\|200x100]]` |
| Embeds | Whole notes, `#Heading` sections and `#^block` references, nested up to four deep |
| Lists | Bulleted, numbered, and task items with checkboxes |
| Quotes | A bar per nesting level |
| Callouts | With Obsidian's type colors and their fold state |
| Tables | With column alignment, laid out as described below |
| Code blocks | With a language label; long lines scroll rather than wrap |
| Frontmatter | As a properties block at the top of the note |
| Footnotes | Numbered by order of first reference, collected at the end |

## Clicking things

- **A wikilink or Markdown link to a note** opens it.
- **`[[Note#Heading]]`** opens the note scrolled to that heading.
- **`[[Note#^block-id]]`** opens it scrolled to that block.
- **A tag** searches the vault for it.
- **A footnote reference** jumps to the definition.
- **A link inside an embedded note** works, and opens the note it points at — not the note
  the embed is in.

## How tables lay out

Obsidian renders a table as an HTML table, which means the browser's automatic table layout
decides the columns. Scoria reproduces that with the real font metrics:

1. Each column *wants* the width of its widest cell.
2. Each column *needs* at least the width of its longest unbreakable word.
3. If the sum of the wishes fits the note's width, every column gets its wish.
4. Otherwise the slack between each column's minimum and its wish is shared out in
   proportion.

The practical consequence, and the reason it was worth implementing rather than giving every
column an equal share: a table with one long identifier in it does not break that identifier
across lines, and a narrow column does not get the same width as a wide one.

Fenced code blocks never wrap. A long line scrolls sideways inside its own block.

## Long notes

The view lays out one item per top-level block, measured lazily, so only what is on screen is
ever laid out. A 50,000-line note opens and scrolls like a short one.

## Not yet

The gaps, honestly — none of these are in reading view today:

| Not drawn | What you see instead |
|---|---|
| Math (`$x$`, `$$x$$`) | The source text, unrendered |
| HTML in a note | The tags as literal text |
| Remote images (`https://…`) | Nothing; local images work |
| Canvas and Bases files | The file is recognized but does not open |
| Heading folding | Headings do not collapse |
| Toggling a task checkbox | Checkboxes render but are not clickable here — toggle them in [Live Preview](/docs/app/editing/) |
| Copy buttons on code blocks | Select and copy |
| PDF export | — |

Frontmatter edge cases match Obsidian: a `<script>` in a note is removed, unknown HTML
elements are unwrapped, and a raw `<a>` gains `target` and `rel`.
