# Development

## Environment

The reference development machine runs NixOS on Wayland with an NVIDIA GPU. The GPUI app links
libxcb and libxkbcommon and loads Wayland, Vulkan, and GL at run time, so run cargo commands that
touch the `scoria` crate inside `nix-shell` (see `shell.nix` at the repository root).

> [!warning] Pinned dependencies
> `gpui` and `gpui_platform` are git dependencies pinned to a Zed release commit; the crates.io
> release crashes on NVIDIA. `libc` is pinned in `Cargo.lock` because an old `xattr` in gpui's tree
> needs a constant newer libc removed. Both pins are explained in the root `Cargo.toml`.

```

`scoria-mcp` speaks the control protocol as an MCP server over stdio, and
launches the app itself. Register it in `.mcp.json`, with an absolute repo path
since `SCORIA_MCP_BIN` runs through `sh -c` when it contains a space:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scoria": {
      "command": "/path/to/scoria/target/release/scoria-mcp",
      "env": {
        "SCORIA_MCP_REPO": "/path/to/scoria",
        "SCORIA_MCP_BIN": "nix-shell --run \"target/release/scoria\"",
        "SCORIA_MCP_SOCKET": "/run/user/1000/scoria-mcp.sock",
        "SCORIA_MCP_SCREENSHOT": "spectacle -b -n -a -o {path}",
        "SCORIA_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS": "15000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the app: click a file or a link to open it, Ctrl+P opens the command
palette, Ctrl+E toggles reading view and editing (Live Preview unless
`livePreview` is off), `editor:toggle-source` from the palette switches Live
Preview and Source mode, Ctrl+F and Ctrl+H find and replace in the note,
Ctrl+Alt+Left and Right walk the tab's history,
Ctrl+O opens the quick switcher, Ctrl+Shift+F the Search tab, Ctrl+G the
graph (again to return), Ctrl+, opens Settings, Ctrl+S saves (edits also save
on their own two seconds after the last keystroke), Ctrl+N creates a note,
F2 renames the open one, Ctrl+Q quits. A note opens in the vault's
`defaultViewMode` (editing unless it says `preview`). Every shortcut except
Ctrl+Q is an Obsidian command bound from its default hotkey, so the vault's
`hotkeys.json` rebinds or unbinds it. Right-click a file or folder in Files
for new note, new folder, rename, move, copy and delete; clicking a link to a
note that does not exist, or pressing Enter in the switcher on a name nothing
matches, creates it. In the graph: wheel zooms, drag pans, drag a node to
move it, click a node to open it, Ctrl+0 refits the view.

## Releases

`.github/workflows/release.yml` and `.forgejo/workflows/release.yml` both fire on a `v*` tag. Cut a
release by bumping `version` under `[workspace.package]` in the root `Cargo.toml`, committing that,
then tagging and pushing to both remotes:

```
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Scoria 0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0 && git push forgejo v0.1.0
```

Either workflow refuses to build when the tag and the workspace version disagree, since the archive
is named from the tag and the binary reports the manifest version. GitHub builds
`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-apple-darwin` — one archive per
target, plus `SHA256SUMS` over all of them — and publishes with `gh release create`. The homelab
Forgejo runner has only the Linux container (see [[#Environment]] and `ci.yml`), so it
builds the x86_64 Linux archive and creates the release through the instance API with the token
Forgejo Actions injects for the run. Release notes on both are the commit subjects since the
previous tag. A tag with a hyphen in it, `v0.2.0-rc1`, is published as a prerelease.

Both builds pass `--locked`, so the pinned `gpui` revision and `libc` come from `Cargo.lock`.

Both workflows sign `SHA256SUMS` with GPG when the repository holds the maintainer's key as the
secrets `GPG_SIGNING_KEY` (the armored private key, `gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <fpr>`) and
`GPG_PASSPHRASE`; without them the release is published unsigned and its notes say so. To set them
up once: `gpg --full-generate-key`, then
`gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <fpr> | gh secret set GPG_SIGNING_KEY` and
`gh secret set GPG_PASSPHRASE`, and the same two secrets in the Forgejo repository settings; publish
the public key (`gpg --armor --export <fpr>`) somewhere a reader can fetch it, such as
keys.openpgp.org, and put the fingerprint in the README. The GitHub workflow also attaches
[build provenance attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations)
to every archive, which need no secret: `gh attestation verify <archive> --repo ragtux/scoria`
confirms the archive came out of this workflow at that commit. Private vulnerability reporting is
enabled on the GitHub repository, and `SECURITY.md` at the root is the policy.

### Tabs, the layout file, the ribbon, the Hotkeys tab and the graph panel, 2026-10-20

The five largest entries left in [[UI parity backlog]] after the campaign were builds rather than
fixes, and they went in one after another, each driven over the control socket on a scratch copy of
this vault before it was committed.

**Tabs.** A `Tab` is a path, a mode and its own history. The active tab's fields are the ones the
workspace always had — `current`, `mode`, `history`, `history_ix` — so every route that opens a
note is unchanged, and `tabs[active_tab]` is a snapshot refreshed before anything reads it. That
shape was chosen over accessors because seventy call sites read those fields and none of them
needed to know. The editor still holds one buffer: switching tabs saves and reloads, the way opening
a note does, which is also why a tab switch loses the scroll position the way history navigation
does (the open entry on history covers both). The last close leaves Obsidian's empty "New tab", and
a closed tab remembers its index so `undo-close-pane` puts it back where it was.

**workspace.json.** Reading it is a walk of the leaves under `main`, depth first across groups —
Scoria has one strip, so a split layout is flattened to show it. Writing it back is the decision
the backlog had left open under the vault-is-truth rule; the answer is to write only what the
session changed and only what Scoria models: a restored leaf keeps its id and every key Obsidian
gave it, a new tab gets a sixteen-hex-digit id, `lastOpenFiles` is brought up to date, the dock
`collapsed` keys follow the toggles, and a main area with more than one tab group is left exactly
as it was, because flattening it on disk would lose the user's layout the next time Obsidian
opened the vault. The quit write goes through the merging config writer, so an unchanged layout is
byte-identical. The diff of the scratch vault's file after a session that closed every tab was
one leaf, `active`, and the order of `lastOpenFiles`.

**The ribbon** is five command buttons and Settings; `left-ribbon.hiddenItems` hides by the plugin
id its key starts with, and a disabled core plugin's entry is not drawn. The sidebar toggles were
the real gap: with the ribbon hidden, a collapsed left dock had no way back from the window.

**The Hotkeys tab** turned up a writer bug worth remembering. The merging `write_config` keeps a
key the new value lacks — right for every config file that is a struct, wrong for `hotkeys.json`,
which *is* a map of entries, where dropping a command's entry is what restores its defaults. The
first live run showed the tab on defaults while the file still held the custom chord. The fix is a
second writer, `Vault::replace_config`, that writes the value whole, used for that file alone. The
chord itself is a gpui `Keystroke` turned into Obsidian's spelling: `KeyboardEvent.key`
(`ArrowLeft`, `F5`, ` ` for space, letters upper-cased), modifiers alphabetical, Ctrl as `Mod`,
Super as `Meta`. Rebinding is a clear of every key binding and all of them again from the rebuilt
registry; one false alarm during the run was pressing Escape and the new chord in the same socket
request, before the frame that restores the workspace's handlers after a modal closes had painted.

**The graph panel** replaces the chip row. Its sliders are canvases with their own hitbox, and the
panel occludes, which is what keeps a slider drag from also panning the graph: the graph's canvas
used to accept any mouse-down inside its bounds and now asks its hitbox. `graph.json` is written a
third of a second after a change. A vault without the file gets the twenty keys in Obsidian's
order — the test pins it at the 494 bytes Obsidian's own creation write measured — and a vault
with it gets the changed keys merged in so `0.518713248970312` keeps its digits; whole numbers are
written without a decimal point the way JavaScript prints them, and the last group removed is
written as `[]`, both of which the merge would otherwise have got wrong. Force changes reach the
running layout's `forces` and reheat it; filter and group changes rebuild; display changes repaint.

### The parity campaign, 2026-10-20

[[#Control socket and MCP server, 2026-10-19]] ends with the first thing the socket caught: three
backlog entries that were one bug seen from three panes, settled by asking the running app what the
editor did after a heading jump. This is what happened when that question was asked of the whole
window.

**What the socket made possible.** Every flag under [[#Commands]] arranges a state at startup and
then the app is on its own, so an audit over those flags is an audit of screenshots: you can see
that something looks wrong and you cannot ask why, or what the app thinks it just did. Over the
socket a finding is a transcript — the keystroke, the `state` before, the `state` after — and the
reviewer reads the same transcript the auditor did. Two measuring tricks came out of the run and
are worth keeping, because the state dump exposes no *rendered* text (`Editor::describe` reports
the cursor, selection, scroll and visible lines, never the `DisplayLine`), so colour, weight, pills
and labels are simply not observable from outside. The first is a y-scan: click every second pixel
down the editor and read back which line each point resolves to, which gives every row's exact
height — a 24 px text row, a 56 px collapsed callout, a ~104 px image widget — and so separates a
laid-out widget from a line of text without a screenshot. The second is an x-scan: sweep across one
row and map display columns back to source columns, which shows exactly which bytes are hidden or
substituted, and settles a question like `Note#Heading` versus `Note > Heading` to within a
character width. Both are race-free. The other thing the socket bought is plain parallelism: eight
agents, one subsystem and one app each, at the same time.

**The shape of the audit.** Eight probes ran in parallel — Files, Live Preview, reading view, right
dock and graph, search and the modals, Settings, the source editor, the workspace shell — and every
finding then went to an adversarial reviewer whose main job was the *Obsidian* half. That is where
the previous pass had failed: of its four refutations, all four were Scoria behaving correctly
against an Obsidian behaviour the auditor had remembered rather than observed. The pass confirmed 82
findings over seven subsystems and refuted seven, and two of the refutations
are worth remembering by anyone who drives the app this way, because they were the harness, not the
app: "Tab types a literal tab into the find field" and "Shift+Enter inserts a newline into the
prompt" both come from gpui's `Window::dispatch_keystroke`, whose first line is
`keystroke.with_simulated_ime()` — it fabricates a `key_char` for `tab`, `enter` and `space`
whenever control, alt and platform are absent, and *shift is not excluded*. No user can reproduce
either. A socket-driven claim about a key needs that check before it is filed.

**The accident: there were two audits.** That first pass did not finish in one sitting — it hit a
session limit partway and was resumed. The resumed probe agents did not replay from cache; they
re-ran, and what came back was a genuinely independent second audit of the same window, worded
differently and reaching 92 findings where the first reached 82. Nobody noticed at the time. The
fix campaign took the first pass plus the second pass's Live Preview file — which is the only Live
Preview file either run produced — and worked from those 95, while the second pass's other 79
findings sat unread. That is a process error, and the arithmetic it produced is what gave it away:
the counts in the notes did not add up.

It was also the luckiest thing that happened. Two blind audits of one window, graded against each
other, say more than either alone. Triaging the second pass's 79 against the *finished* binary
gave a result that is worth more than a re-read of the first pass's list: 27 were already fixed, 52
still reproduced, and the triage's evidence is against the current code rather than the code as it
was, so where the two passes overlap its line numbers and its repros are the ones to act on. It
corrected the first pass in both directions — it narrowed the properties-in-reading-view finding to
one third of its filed scope, settled the `0` chip question against the backlog's own prediction,
showed that the published fix sketch for the empty-rename error pointed at the wrong file, and
caught a fix the first verification pass had scored as complete when only one of its two routes was
closed. And it found, by a route neither audit had used, the worst bug in the campaign. Two
independent passes is not a cost to apologise for; the thing to fix is that only one of them was
read.

Seven waves of fixes followed, each wave a set of agents partitioned by file ownership, with
`cargo fmt --all`, `cargo check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` and
`cargo test --workspace` as the gate between waves. Two fleets of verification agents then drove
the rebuilt release binary: the first found 35 fixes confirmed, 12 partly done, one not done and 11
regressions, and the second re-drove the repairs and swept the window unscripted.

**What the fixes found that code reading had not.** The Writer gate turned out to be the sharpest
tool in the campaign, because `drive_session` now runs every new editing command over all 1000
corpus notes and over the real vault. It caught two byte hazards nobody had predicted: the first
`swap_lines` happily swapped the last content line with the phantom empty line a file's trailing
newline creates, which would have stripped that newline from every file it touched, and
`delete_paragraph` can empty a note to zero bytes — correct behaviour, but the harness's "the
session wrote something" guard had to be made honest about it. Auto-pairing produced a second one
only a test could see: wrapping two *touching* selections wrote `(alpha()beta)`, because
`apply_edits` sorts back to front and an opener and a closer landing at the same offset are
order-sensitive; writing the wrap as one edit over the whole selection removed the whole class.
The frontmatter-link fix was reproduced as a unit test before it was written, and the test showed a
self-contradiction inside one cache — `resolved_links("Source.md")` counted the property link while
`backlinks("Target.md")` was empty. And the setext fix proved a negative: dumping what
`highlight_lines` actually emits showed the clipped heading span covering the whole of *both* rows
(`0..2` over `==` and `0..2` over `==`), so a pure function of one line's text and spans cannot tell
a title row from an underline row, whatever heuristic it uses. That is what moved the fix into the
parser, where `BlockKind::Heading` has carried a `setext` flag all along and `collect_blocks` was
throwing it away.

**The three things only an unscripted pass could have found.** The second verification fleet was
told to drive the rebuilt binary the way a person would rather than to re-run the repros, and that
is where the campaign's own damage surfaced. Two of the three were regressions this campaign
introduced, and both compiled, passed clippy and passed every test.

The first is focus after a delete. The fix for "typing into a deleted note is silently discarded"
parks the keyboard on the workspace handle when the main area goes empty — correct — and nothing
ever hands it back, because `open_file` never called the new `focus_main`. So: delete the open
note, then open any other note by any route — the switcher, an explorer row, history — and the
editor paints the note while `focus` is still `{workspace, ["Workspace"]}`, `type` answers
`{"target":"none"}` and the arrow keys answer `handled: false`. Every note opened for the rest of
the session is keyboard-dead until the user happens to click inside the editor. No test could have
caught it: focus lives in a painted frame's dispatch tree, and `crates/scoria` has no gpui window
harness.

The second is an empty list property. The property-pill work routes a click on a list-valued row's
value cell to `PropertyAction::EditItem { index: items.len() }` — the empty input Obsidian keeps
after the pills. For `aliases: []` the pill strip has no children, so the flex container has zero
height, so gpui gives it no hitbox, so the handler never runs and the click falls through to the
editor behind. The visible result is worse than a dead cell: the next keystrokes go to the editor
caret, and the sweep that found it left `Zed, Alpha` on its own line *inside* the YAML fences —
corrupted frontmatter from two clicks and a word. The cause is layout, not the action, and the fix
is `Row::is_blank()` drawing the same faint placeholder an absent value draws, so the row has a
height and therefore a hitbox.

The third was not ours, and it is the widest: clicking any dock row — an explorer row, a search
result, an outline row, a backlink — blurs the editor. The root div's `track_focus` focuses the
workspace handle on any mouse-down outside a focusable child, and none of those row handlers asked
for the keyboard back, so the note opens and then neither typing nor the arrow keys do anything
until the user clicks inside the text. It had been true all along; nobody had written a repro for
"open a note the way a person opens a note, then try to type". All three are fixed, the first two
in wave 7 through one rule — when what the main area shows changes, the keyboard goes to whatever
that area paints, requested by the handlers that have no `&mut Window` and honoured at the top of
the next `render`.

The honest reading of that is that parallel agents editing one tree produce regressions, and the
gates did not catch them because a regression of this kind compiles and passes. The live sweep did.
Budget for it: a wave of fixes is not finished when the gate is green, it is finished when somebody
has driven the thing.

**Wave 8: the bug nobody was looking for.** The triage agents were asked, among other things, to
try the app with text that is not ASCII. One of them wrote a note holding 45 letters, a non-breaking
space, and then the search term — and the window disappeared. The log:

```
thread '<unnamed>' panicked at crates/scoria/src/search.rs:552:31:
start byte index 46 is not a char boundary; it is inside '\u{a0}' (bytes 45..47)
thread 'main' panicked at async-task-4.7.1/src/task.rs:452:45: Task polled after completion
```

The snippet windowing walked back to the whitespace before the hit with
`body[start..first].find(char::is_whitespace)` and then `start += sp + 1`, which is correct only
while whitespace is one byte; U+00A0, U+2009 and U+3000 are not, and the slice two lines later cut
inside the character. Reproduced again with the ideographic space. Note where the panic ended up:
it was raised on the background `run_search` task and still took the main thread down with it, so
*any* panic in search is fatal to the process and to whatever the user had not saved.

The second thing is the same shape without the crash, filed by the second audit pass — the one the
campaign never read — and confirmed live by the same triage. Backspace and the arrow
keys stepped by `char`, so one Backspace turned `é` into a bare `e`, split 🇩🇪 into a lone regional
indicator, or left a dangling zero-width joiner at the end of a family emoji — and two seconds later
the autosave wrote that into the vault. That is the only silent corruption either audit turned up,
and the ground rule it breaks is the first one in the repo.

Both are now fixed. The windowing moved out of the gpui crate into a pure
`crates/scoria-search/src/snippet.rs` whose `floor`/`ceil` helpers snap every window edge — and
every hit range, so a stale range widens instead of slicing — to a character boundary, with the
live panic written as a unit test *before* the fix and a second test sliding a lead-in of emoji,
CJK, a combining accent and an NBSP past the window edge one byte at a time. The agent then went
looking for siblings of the class and found one in `fuzzy.rs`, where `simple_search` mapped
lowercased byte offsets back to the candidate by counting characters; it now carries a per-byte
source map, and `İstanbul` is its test. `scoria-text` steps by grapheme cluster for Backspace,
forward Delete, Left/Right, the shifted variants and word motion, and the auto-pair rule only
treats a single-character cluster as half of a pair. Wave 8 also closed the second route into the
typeable empty state: deleting the open note was hardened in wave 1, but `Editor::new` still seeded
the name `"untitled"`, which is exactly the thing `main_view` tests to decide whether a buffer has
a file behind it — so every launch that opened no markdown, an empty vault or a vault holding only
a canvas, handed the user a live editor over nothing and discarded what they typed into it.

**The second lesson.** The two deepest defects in the whole campaign — a process-killing panic and
a silent corruption that reached the vault — were found by typing unusual text into the running
app. Not by reading code: both sites read perfectly well, and one of them had been read by an
auditor who filed four other findings in the same file. Not by a scripted repro either, because a
repro is written from a hypothesis and nobody hypothesised a non-breaking space. They came from an
agent with a licence to try odd input against a live binary. A vault of real prose is full of
pasted NBSPs, CJK punctuation, accented names, flags and family emoji, and every one of them is an
input the test corpus does not contain. The class to grep for is narrow and worth grepping for
again: an offset into user text computed by arithmetic — `+ 1`, `len()`, `chars().count()` — rather
than taken from `char_indices`, a regex engine or a grapheme cursor.

**The lesson worth keeping.** Partitioning by file ownership is what let eight agents edit one tree
at once, and it worked — the waves landed with no merge conflicts and the gate was green between
each. What it cost is every item that needed two owners. The list property is the worked example.
Wave 4a built the whole per-item model in `properties.rs`, with tests proving a comma survives the
round trip; wave 4b built the renderer in `reading/view.rs` that draws an open field in its pill's
place. Both landed, both were correct, and the user-visible behaviour did not change at all,
because the only route from a click to an open field runs through `Editor::property_action`, whose
`match` over `PropertyAction` is exhaustive — adding the variant the pills needed would have left
`editor.rs` not compiling for every other agent in the wave. Three waves of careful handoff notes
later, the item was fixed in one wave by one agent holding `editor.rs`, `reading/view.rs` and
`properties.rs` together. The same shape explains the callout chevron (fold state has to live on
`Editor`, the chevron is drawn in `reading/view.rs`), the modal focus theft (two `.occlude()` calls
in `workspace.rs`, useless without the hitbox the editor agent had already added), and the
frontmatter links (the cache half shipped a wave before the pane that reads it). The rule to carry
forward: scope a group by the *change*, not by the file, and when a change needs two files, give
one agent both — a handoff note across a wave boundary costs more than the conflict it avoids.

**Where it ended.** 501 tests pass, clippy is clean across the workspace, and the Writer gate over
the real PLMCRZY vault still round-trips 14/14 byte-identical, which is the number that matters:
nothing in a campaign's worth of UI work moved a byte in a vault, and the one path that *was*
moving bytes it should not — the grapheme split — is closed. Of the 95 findings the waves worked
from, 54 are fixed. Of the second pass's other 79, 27 were already fixed by that work and two more
by wave 8, leaving 50 that still reproduce — most of them the same large gaps the first pass had
filed, a dozen of them sharper than the first pass had them, and twenty that nobody had filed at
all. All of it, with the probes the declined items are waiting on, is in [[UI parity backlog]].

### Control socket and MCP server, 2026-10-19

The flag list under [[#Commands]] kept growing, and every flag on it does the
same kind of thing: it arranges a state at startup and then the app is on its
own. `--type` can open the autocompletion popup for a screenshot, but it cannot
ask whether the popup opened, which row is selected, or what the status bar said
afterwards. [[#The probe batch, 2026-10-18]] recorded why the obvious escape is
shut: there is no `xdotool` on this machine and a synthetic event carries no
focus, so input has to be driven from inside the process — which is what
`--stress`, `--type` and `--accept` already were, self-driven input one scenario
at a time, compiled in. A socket keeps the self-driven input and moves the loop
outside the binary, so whatever drives can read the answer and decide what to
do next.

It is the Scoria-side counterpart to `tools/obsidian-probe/`. That harness
drives a real Obsidian over CDP to learn what Obsidian does
([[#Driving Obsidian over CDP, 2026-10-18]]); this one drives Scoria to check
what Scoria does against it. Two apps, the same shape of harness, and neither
belongs in CI.

**The protocol.** `--control <path>` binds a Unix domain socket and speaks
newline-delimited JSON over it: one request per line, one response line per
request, in order.

```
--> {"id":1,"method":"state","params":{"text":false}}
<-- {"id":1,"result":{...}}
<-- {"id":2,"error":"unknown method: frobnicate"}
```

Positions are window-local logical pixels. Byte offsets are zero-based into the
note's UTF-8 bytes, like Obsidian's `Pos`, and line and column are zero-based
too. Every failure — unknown method, a parameter of the wrong type, no vault
open, a path outside the vault — comes back as a plain string in `error`.
Nothing that crosses the socket may panic.

| method | params | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ping` | – | `{"ok","protocol","version"}` |
| `protocol` | – | the method table as JSON |
| `wait_loaded` | `timeout_ms?` | `{"loaded","timed_out"}` |
| `wait_idle` | `frames?`, `timeout_ms?` | `{"frames","parsing","timed_out"}` |
| `state` | `text?`, `rows?` | the state dump |
| `open` | `name` (`Note#Heading`, `Note#^id`), `mode?` | `{"current"}` |
| `open_path` | `path`, `mode?` | `{"current"}` |
| `set_mode` | `mode`: reading, live, source, graph | `{"mode"}` |
| `command` | `id` | `{"status"}` — the status bar after it ran |
| `keys` | `keys`: gpui keystrokes, `["ctrl-shift-f","enter"]` | `{"handled","pending"}` |
| `type` | `text` | `{"target"}`: editor, input or none |
| `click` | `x`, `y`, `button?`, `count?`, `mods?` | `{"ok"}` |
| `mouse` | `action`: down, up, move; `x`, `y`, `button?`, `mods?` — a `move` naming a `button` is a drag in progress | `{"ok"}` |
| `scroll` | `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `unit?`: pixels, lines | `{"ok"}` |
| `set_selection` | `start`, `end?` (byte offsets) | `{"cursor"}` |
| `scroll_to` | `line` | `{"ok"}` |
| `focus` | `set?`: workspace, editor, reading, graph | `{"name","context_stack"}` |
| `window` | `activate?`, `width?`, `height?` | `{"width","height","scale","active"}` |
| `read_file` | `path` | `{"text","bytes"}` |
| `write_file` | `path`, `text` | `{"bytes"}` |
| `list_files` | `folder?` | path, kind and size per file |
| `list_commands` | – | id, name, hotkeys and whether it is runnable |
| `notice_clear` | – | `{"ok"}` |
| `quit` | – | `{"ok"}`, written before the app exits |

**The state dump.** `state` answers one object in which every key is always
present and absence is `null`, so a driver can index into it without guarding
each step. `vault` is the root, name and load state; `file` the open path, mode,
dirty flag and tab history; `tabs` the strip — each tab's path, mode and
title, and which is active; `docks` the explorer's rows and the search pane's
query, counts and results on the left, outline, backlinks, outgoing links and
tags on the right; `modal` which of the switcher, palette, Settings, prompt or
chooser is up and its query, selection and row labels; `editor` the cursor,
selection, scroll, visible line range, line count, find panel and suggest
popup; then `reading`, `graph`, `status`, `focus` and `window`. The note's text
is there only when `params.text` is true, and list-valued keys are cut to
`params.rows` entries with a sibling `*_total` saying how many there were.

**What the MCP server adds.** `scoria-mcp` is the thing a user registers in
`.mcp.json`: a Model Context Protocol server over stdio, JSON-RPC 2.0, with no
dependencies beyond `scoria-control`, `serde` and `serde_json`. Stdout carries
the protocol, so everything it logs goes to stderr. Three things it does that
the socket cannot: it launches and reaps the app itself, so `scoria_launch`
spawns the binary with `--control`, waits for the socket to appear and then
blocks on `wait_loaded`; it takes screenshots, through `spectacle` into base64
image content; and it builds its tool input schemas from
`scoria_control::METHODS` and `params_schema` instead of hand-writing them, so
a method added to the table above arrives as a tool with the right parameters
and no second description to keep in step. After any tool that changes state it
calls `wait_idle` before returning, so the next `scoria_state` or screenshot is
current rather than one frame behind. A tool that fails is `isError: true`
content, not a JSON-RPC error — only an unknown method or malformed parameters
are those.

**Five pitfalls, in the order they are likely to bite.**

- **Focus decides where keys go.** `type` routes text to whatever is focused
  and reports which of the editor, a text input or nothing received it; `focus`
  names the focused handle and returns the key context stack. Read one of them
  before typing, not after wondering where the text went.
- **A modal captures keys.** While `modal.kind` is anything but `none`, the
  switcher, palette, prompt, chooser or Settings has the keyboard, and keys
  meant for the editor go there instead. `state.modal` carries its query,
  selection and rows, which is also how a driver tells a modal apart from a
  slow frame.
- **Autosave's two-second delay makes `read_file` stale.** Edits save on their
  own two seconds after the last keystroke, so a `read_file` straight after a
  `type` reads the bytes from before the edit. Either wait the delay out or run
  the save command — `list_commands` has its id — before reading.
- **`wait_idle` can time out with nothing wrong.** KWin stops delivering frame
  callbacks when the monitors sleep, so a wait for the next frames never
  completes; it answers `timed_out: true` rather than hanging, and the fix is
  at the desk, not in the code. Wake the display before a run that needs
  repaints.
- **Wayland reports no window origin.** `Window::bounds().origin` is always
  zero there, so `window` answers size, scale and active state and no position,
  and the screenshot grabs the *active* window (`spectacle -a`) rather than a
  rectangle on the screen. The window sets its `app_id` to `scoria` for that
  reason: KWin honours the xdg-activation token `activate_window()` asks for
  only from a window it can identify, and without it a screenshot can catch
  whatever had focus before.

**The first thing it caught.** Eight readers went over the window looking for
places where Scoria and Obsidian disagree, and the list is in
[[UI parity backlog]]; what the socket added was a way to settle one of them
without squinting at a screenshot. Three of those findings were the same bug
seen from three panes: following `[[Note#Heading]]`, clicking an outline row,
a backlink or a search hit only scrolled the reading view. Asking the running
app, in Live Preview, what the editor did after a heading jump:

```
live    scroll   0 ->   0  cursor   0 ->   0  visible [0, 33]
```

Nothing. The jump went to a view that was not on screen, and Live Preview is
the default mode, so the whole of that navigation did nothing a user could
see. `Workspace::reveal_offset` now moves both views and `Editor::reveal_offset`
puts the cursor on the target, revealing it on the next paint through the
editor's own `pending_reveal` (there is no window at hand on that path, so the
scroll cannot be computed where the click is handled). The same question
afterwards:

```
live    scroll   0 ->  89  cursor   0 -> 123  visible [89, 123]
```

Obsidian also flashes the target line, which is still missing.

### Canvas writer, 2026-10-19

[[#What opening the vault in Obsidian changed, 2026-10-18]] left
`Canvas::to_json` as a known byte loss waiting for phase 4 to connect it,
with three open questions. Rather than fix it to the one observed file, the
questions went to the CDP harness first: `tools/obsidian-probe/canvas.mjs`
writes scratch canvases with every node and edge type, every optional key in
a scrambled order and unknown keys at every level, then opens, closes,
drags, moves and creates in a real Obsidian and reads the bytes back. Four
runs, a few minutes each. The answers are in
[[Specification#Observed canvas write behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4 (installer build 1.13.7)]];
what follows is what they changed in the design.

**The key order is not a table, it is an algorithm.** The first file
suggested a fixed order with `text` before the geometry. The scrambled
fixture showed the truth: Obsidian's `getData` starts from the object it
read, with the keys the model owns deleted, and assigns the model's keys
onto it — JavaScript keeps an existing key's position and appends a new
one. So `text`, `type`, `file`, `url`, `backgroundStyle` and any plugin key
stay where the file had them, and `x, y, width, height, color` always land
after them. That is why the gate vault's `id, x, y, ..., type, text` became
`id, type, text, x, y, ...`, and why a node Obsidian creates (no file order)
is written `id, x, y, width, height, type, text` — an order that is *not* a
fixed point of its own reader. `Node`, `Edge` and `Canvas` now carry the
file's key order and write through that algorithm; a node made in Scoria
carries none and comes out as an app-made one.

**Two mistakes the fixtures caught.** The first draft sorted groups first
on every write, because the loaded fixtures came back that way. The nodes
created through the API did not: Obsidian partitions on *load* and appends
afterwards, so the partition moved into the reader. The second draft
asserted that every Obsidian-written fixture round-trips byte-identical,
and two did not — the app-made ones, for the reason above. Both are now
tests that say the opposite of what the draft assumed.

**The formatter rule is `typeof`.** A container stays on one line unless
one of its values is `null`, an object or an array — JavaScript's
`typeof v === 'object'`, null included, which took a fourth run with
`[true,false]` against `[null]` to separate from "has a nested container".
Numbers follow `JSON.stringify` (`1e3` → `1000`, `-0` → `0`), so `Node`'s
geometry is `f64` now; a canvas with `"x":0.5` parsed in Obsidian and
would have been refused by the old `i64`.

**Closing is a write.** Opening a canvas writes nothing; closing it
rewrites the file through the formatter even when nothing was edited,
keeping the file's own key order. For the gate run that means a canvas
Obsidian merely looked at will show in the diff — reformatted, not
reordered — and Scoria, which writes nothing on close, will not do the
same. That asymmetry is recorded rather than copied.

**Checked against the real vault.** The harness has a new property: every
`.canvas` in Obsidian's layout is written back byte-identical. The gate
vault's `Data Pipeline Mindmap.canvas`, the 4731-byte file Obsidian wrote
on 2026-10-18, passes; `PLMCRZY Mindmap.canvas` is reported as authored
elsewhere, since Obsidian itself will rewrite it whole the first time it is
saved there. Nothing in the app calls the writer yet; when phase 4 does,
the bytes are settled.

### Porting two checklist blocks to CDP, 2026-10-19

The first two blocks of [[Interaction probes]] — the search pane and
properties in the reading view — were ported from hand steps to scripts
under `tools/obsidian-probe/` and run against Obsidian 1.14.4 (installer
build 1.13.7) in fresh scratch vaults. Each script runs in three phases:
`fixtures` with Obsidian down (the notes are written with `fs`, mtimes set
with `utimes`), `run` with it up, and `after-restart` if `run` ended by
quitting it — which is how "does the sort survive a restart" and "does the
fold survive a restart" are answered with a real relaunch. `run-block.sh`
owns the lifecycle: fresh vault, fresh id, `obsidian.json` swapped in and
restored byte-identical. Search took 31 steps and properties 15, no
failures, and the observations are in [[Specification]] under the two
sections' 2026-10-19 paragraphs.

**Three traps in the runner, each found the hard way.**

- The anchored kill pattern from the plugin days,
  `^/nix/store/[^ ]*electron /nix/store/[^ ]*obsidian`, never matches an
  Obsidian launched with `--remote-debugging-port`: the flag sits between the
  binary and the asar. So the kill was a no-op, the survivor's single-instance
  lock swallowed the next launch, and the properties script drove the
  **search** vault for thirteen steps while believing otherwise. The script
  had even recorded `vault: "vault-search"` in its first step and carried on.
  The runner now waits for both the process and the CDP endpoint to be gone,
  and `launch` refuses to proceed unless `app.vault.adapter.basePath` is the
  vault it asked for.
- A vault id in `obsidian.json` must be sixteen hex characters. A malformed
  one is silently ignored and no vault window opens.
- Reusing an id across folders inherits that id's IndexedDB cache: a search
  on a brand-new vault returned the previous vault's files until the re-index
  caught up. Fresh id per scratch vault, and no trust dialog is involved when
  no plugin is enabled — CDP needs none.

**The copy-results detour.** "Copy search results" lives in the result-count
menu, and a real click on it left the clipboard untouched for two seconds,
with no notice. Calling the handler directly threw on `preventDefault`;
reading its source gave `function(e){e.preventDefault(),new
x2(this.app,this.dom).open()}` — it opens a **modal**, and three scripts had
watched the clipboard and the menus without once looking for one. The modal
has a Show path toggle, Link style (None, Wikilink, Markdown link) and List
prefix (None, Dash, Asterisk, Numbered) dropdowns, a preview textarea and a
`Copy results` button; a fourth script enumerated all twenty-four
combinations and pressed the button, and the clipboard matched the preview
byte for byte. The lesson is general: after a click, also ask the DOM whether
a `.modal-container` appeared.

**A second kind of mistake, caught by reading the output.** The first
twenty-four-variant run looked complete and was wrong: it set the *first*
`<select>` for every setting, so the List prefix rows measured the Link style
control being handed values it did not have. The rows did not change, which
read as "List prefix does nothing" until the script was reread. A probe that
reports its own input back is the failure mode the verifier stage exists for;
here it was caught before that stage by noticing the rows were identical.

### Driving Obsidian over CDP, 2026-10-18

[[#The probe batch, 2026-10-18]] concluded that interaction could not be
probed on this machine, because a synthetic DOM event carries no focus and
there is no `xdotool`. That conclusion was wrong, and the correction matters
more than the batch did.

**Obsidian is Electron, so it speaks the Chrome DevTools Protocol.** Launch
it as `obsidian --remote-debugging-port=9222` and `http://127.0.0.1:9222/json`
lists the page target. CDP's `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` and
`Input.dispatchMouseEvent` are injected by the *browser*, not by JavaScript,
so they carry focus and run the same input path a person's keyboard does —
exactly what `el.dispatchEvent` cannot do. Node 24 has a built-in
`WebSocket`, so the client needs no dependencies at all; the throwaway
plugin is not needed either, since `Runtime.evaluate` reaches `app`.

The endpoint also settles the version question the batch left open: the
target title reads **Obsidian 1.14.4** while the user agent reads
`obsidian/1.13.7 Chrome/150.0.7871.47 Electron/43.1.0`. App 1.14.4 on
installer 1.13.7.

The first run typed thirteen characters and answered the whole auto-pair
item — the one [[Interaction probes]] ranked first and estimated at fifty
minutes of hand work — in about a minute, including the question the batch
had flagged as confounded: **skip-over is provenance-tracked** (Obsidian
skips only a closer it inserted; a planted `)` is pushed along) while
**backspace-deletes-both is positional** (it fires on any empty pair).
Both are now in [[Specification#Observed auto-pair behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4]].

**What this means for the rest of [[Interaction probes]].** Nearly every
block in it is CDP-automatable: real clicks on the search sort dropdown,
real typing into a property field, real mouse drags in the file explorer,
a real anchor click, a scripted quit-and-relaunch for the cold-load case.
What stays human is aesthetic judgement — how `<sup>` looks, whether a
hover affordance feels right — which is a small residue, not eight hours.

**It does not belong in CI, and the reason is not the plumbing.** These
runs assert *Obsidian's* behavior, not Scoria's: a red build would mean
Obsidian changed or the app flaked, which is not a reason to block a merge,
and Obsidian is proprietary, needs a display, and would have to be pinned
and installed on a self-hosted runner. The division that works is the one
this repo already uses for autocompletion in
`scoria-suggest/tests/obsidian_rows.rs`:

- **CI, every push:** Scoria asserted against the *recorded* observation
  tables. Pure Rust, deterministic, no Obsidian. A failure here is a real
  Scoria regression.
- **On demand, when the Obsidian pin moves:** the CDP harness re-derives
  those tables from the live app and the diff is read by a person. A change
  here is news about Obsidian, and it is the moment to update the tables
  and the spec together.
- **By hand, rarely:** the aesthetic residue.

### The probe batch, 2026-10-18

Eleven of the thirteen small-backlog items were blocked on the same thing:
the project implements from observed Obsidian behavior, and nobody had
observed it. So they were probed in one batch rather than one at a time.

**Method.** A throwaway plugin in a disposable scratch vault under the
already-trusted id `5c0r1ac0rpu50001`, eleven independent scenarios run in
sequence from `onLayoutReady`, each in its own `try`/`catch` behind a 25 s
`Promise.race`, with the result file rewritten after every scenario so a
later hang could not cost the earlier answers. A local HTTP server on
127.0.0.1:8731 served images and logged request headers. `obsidian.json` was
backed up, pointed at the scratch vault, and restored byte-identical after
each of the four launches. The gate vault was untouched: PLMCRZY's mtimes all
predate the run and it still matches `snapshot-2026-10-18` exactly.

Three traps, all new:

- **Obsidian's CSP blocks the plugin's own `fetch`.** The run's
  `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8731/log')` failed with `TypeError: Failed to
  fetch` even though the renderer had just loaded twenty images from that
  same origin. Read a probe server's log from the shell, not from the plugin.
- **A dispatched click on a raw `<a>` navigates the frame.** The HTML
  scenario would have taken the whole app down mid-batch; it needs a
  bubble-phase listener that records `defaultPrevented` as Obsidian left it
  and then cancels the default itself.
- **One hung step loses the whole scenario.** `html-render` burned both a
  25 s and a 90 s budget inside a single step. Bounding every *step*, not
  just the scenario, recovered eleven of its thirteen steps.

**Version.** `apiVersion` reports **1.14.4** while the installer build and
the HTTP user agent both say **1.13.7** (`obsidian/1.13.7 Chrome/150`). The
new sections are labelled 1.14.4 with the installer build named, since the
running code is what was observed.

**Outcome.** Ten new `## Observed ...` sections in [[Specification]], every
one ending in an `**Unprobed:**` paragraph. Each section was written from a
first pass that an adversarial reader then checked claim by claim against the
raw JSON; the checks killed real errors, among them a graph.json claim about
zoom that its own timestamps contradicted, and an attachment-name claim about
percent-encoding that the run never exercised.

**No item came back ready to build.** The limitation is structural and worth
recording: there is no input automation on this machine, and a synthetic
event does not carry focus. Anything that needs a real keystroke or a real
drag — typing into a property field, opening the search sort dropdown, F2
with the explorer focused, a drag with timing — returned nothing. The probe
settled formats, storage, DOM shapes and command ids; it could not settle
interaction. Those remainders are listed per feature in [[Specification]],
and closing them wants a person at the keyboard, not a bigger plugin.

**One result reversed a planned change.** See
[[#The checkbox the padding hid, 2026-10-18]]: clicking a task with a custom
status writes `[ ]` in Obsidian too, so Scoria already matches and
`editor.rs` stays as it is.

### The checkbox the padding hid, 2026-10-18

Planning the reading view's checkbox toggle turned up a defect in the one that
already ships. Live Preview's checkbox came from `highlight.rs`, which placed
the brackets by arithmetic:

```rust
let start = item.marker.end + 1;
```

The block parser is looser than that. `- [x]` may carry **1 to 4 spaces or a
tab** between the marker and the brackets (`block.rs`, `spaces_after_marker` in
`1..5`), so `marker.end + 1` is right for one space, right for a tab by
coincidence, and wrong for every other padding. A `starts_with('[')` guard
caught the miss and dropped the span, so nothing corrupt was ever written —
the checkbox simply **was not there**: `-  [x] a` parsed as a task, rendered
without a box, and ignored the click. Confirmed before the fix across the five
paddings; only one space and a tab produced a span.

The repair is the ground rule applied literally. `ListItem` now carries
`task_span` alongside `task`, recorded in the one place that already knows
where the brackets are — the detection site in `block.rs`, where `self.offset`
is absolute and container markers are consumed, so a task inside a blockquote
or callout spans correctly for free. `highlight.rs` reads that span instead of
recomputing it, and the arithmetic is gone. One parser, one answer.

Two tests pin it: every padding the parser accepts yields exactly one span
that starts and ends on a bracket, and the shapes it rejects (`- [ ]` at end
of line, `- [ ]no space`, five spaces) yield none. Both ratchets are unmoved —
1007/1009 corpus notes and all 652 CommonMark examples — because `render_html`
never read the old derivation.

One thing that looked like a second defect is not one. Clicking a task writes
`[ ]` whenever the status byte is not a space, so `[X]`, `[?]`, `[-]` and
`[>]` all collapse to empty, and the corpus has all four
(`tests/corpus/vault/edge/Blocks.md`) while [[Specification]] commits to "task
items with any single character". That looked like data loss — but the probe
run the same day shows **Obsidian does exactly the same thing**, so
`editor.rs` is right and stays as it is. See
[[#The probe batch, 2026-10-18]].

### What opening the vault in Obsidian changed, 2026-10-18

The vault was opened in Obsidian once, to start the mixed-use half. Sixteen of
the seventeen files came back byte-identical. The one that moved is worth the
whole exercise.

**The four `.obsidian` files were all rewritten and all byte-identical.**
Every one carries a fresh mtime from the moment Obsidian opened the vault, and
every hash matches. So Obsidian rewrites its config set on open and reproduces
it exactly — which is the behavior `Vault::write_config` was built to match,
now confirmed from the other side.

**`Data Pipeline Mindmap.canvas` changed.** The pre-open bytes were recovered
from Obsidian's own file-recovery store
(`~/.config/obsidian/IndexedDB/app_obsidian.md_0.indexeddb.leveldb`, the
canvas text sitting in the log in the clear) and they hash to the baseline
exactly, so the diff is a real one and not a guess. It has two separable
halves:

- **Geometry.** Six nodes have different `x`, `y` or `height`. That is content,
  not formatting, and it is a canvas that was open in front of a person.
- **Format, for the whole file.** 6215 bytes became 4731. The old file was
  2-space pretty-printed with every field on its own line and the key order
  `id, x, y, width, height, type, text, color`. Obsidian wrote back **one node
  per line**, tab-indented, `"nodes":[` with no space after the colon, and the
  key order `id, type, text, x, y, width, height, color`. Neither file ends in
  a newline.

So a canvas written by anything but Obsidian is rewritten whole the first time
Obsidian saves it — the same shape as a table command rewriting its whole
table, one level up. Worth knowing before phase 4 writes one.

**And Scoria could not reproduce that file today.** `Canvas::to_json` uses
serde_json's pretty formatter with a tab, which puts every field on its own
line, and `Node`'s field order puts `text` after `color`. Fed the canvas
Obsidian had just written, it returns 6011 bytes for 4731 in — every line
different. Nothing is broken by it yet, because nothing in Scoria writes a
canvas: `to_json` has no caller outside its own test, and that test only
asserts the output starts `{\n\t"nodes"` and re-parses equal, which a
semantically faithful but byte-different file passes. It is a byte loss
waiting for phase 4 to connect it, and the fix is known: Obsidian's key order
and a formatter that holds a node on one line.

### The gate run opens, 2026-10-18

Every Writer item is done, so the gate is the work. It has two halves. The
half that is ours to decide — every path from a keystroke to a file's bytes —
is the harness, and it now passes over the real vault: all thirteen
properties, `SCORIA_ROUNDTRIP_VAULT=~/bstore2/raga/plmcrzy/PLMCRZY`,
nothing written to the vault (checked after the run by mtime, as the harness
promises: every edit happens in a buffer in memory). The other half is a week
of a person using both apps on the same folder, which has not run.

A **baseline snapshot** makes that week measurable rather than remembered.
It is a copy, not a list of hashes: a hash says a file moved, and the next
question is always *which bytes*.

```
GATE=~/bstore2/raga/scoria-gate; VAULT=~/bstore2/raga/plmcrzy/PLMCRZY
rsync -a --exclude workspace.json "$VAULT"/ "$GATE"/snapshot-<date>/   # take it
diff -r "$GATE"/snapshot-<date> "$VAULT" --exclude workspace.json      # after the week
```

Seventeen files on 2026-10-18. `workspace.json` is left out for the reason it
is left out of the harness: Scoria neither models nor writes it, and Obsidian
rewrites it constantly. A file the diff reports is the gate's evidence — then
the question is which app moved it, and whether the move was a user's edit or
an app rewriting bytes nobody touched.

A hash manifest is kept beside the snapshot for a quick check, but note that
its paths are relative to the vault root, so it only means anything run from
there:

```
( cd "$VAULT" && sha256sum -c "$GATE"/plmcrzy-2026-10-18b.sha256 )
```

The vault is not registered in Obsidian yet (`~/.config/obsidian/obsidian.json`
holds only `docs/scoria`), so the mixed-use half cannot start until it is
opened there once with **Open folder as vault**.

Three gaps came out of pointing the harness at a real vault, all in the
configs rather than the notes:

- **The config round trip ignored the vault.** `config_dirs()` named the two
  sets in the repository and nothing else, so `SCORIA_ROUNDTRIP_VAULT` covered
  a person's notes but never their `.obsidian` — the set that has what a repo
  fixture cannot invent: files missing outright, an `appearance.json` that is
  a bare `{}`, no trailing newline on any of them. It now includes the named
  vault's, and all four of PLMCRZY's round-trip byte-identical.
- **The test could not tell whether the vault had run.** It asserted
  `checked >= 7` against a total the two repository sets reach on their own
  (they hold eight files between them). Each set now has to contribute a file
  of its own, so naming a vault that round-trips nothing fails instead of
  passing quietly.
- **`switcher.json` is written by the app and ratcheted nowhere.**
  `Workspace` writes `app.json`, `appearance.json`, `switcher.json`,
  `core-plugins.json`, `community-plugins.json` and `types.json`; the harness
  listed neither `switcher.json` nor the other per-plugin files. All four are
  listed now, but Obsidian does not create any of them until a setting in that
  plugin is written, so no set on this machine has one and they still cover
  nothing. The same is true of `hotkeys.json`, which no set here has either —
  though Scoria never writes that one. `types.json` has its own round trips in
  `scoria-vault`.

**Thin, and worth saying plainly:** the real vault adds ten hand-written notes
to the corpus's thousand. Pointing the harness at the whole
`~/bstore2/raga/plmcrzy` tree finds 214 more `.md` files, but they are
`node_modules` READMEs rather than notes a person wrote — breadth of Markdown,
not breadth of vault. The corpus is still what covers the shapes; the real
vault covers that a real `.obsidian` survives a write.

### Table editing, 2026-10-18

Obsidian's sixteen table commands work: add, move, duplicate and delete
rows and columns, set a column's alignment, and insert a table. They are in
the palette, bound through their own command ids, and hidden unless the
cursor is in a table — which is what Obsidian's own check callback does.

The commands were probed the way the suggester was, by calling each
command's `editorCheckCallback` over eight shapes of table with the cursor
in two cells, then reading the note back; 186 of the 480 runs had the check
pass, and only those were used. Two traps: the check needs `editor.focus()`
first (without it `executeCommandById` returns true and does nothing), and
it only ever passes in **Live Preview** — in raw source mode Obsidian will
not run a table command at all. Scoria runs them in Source mode too, since
its Source mode is a real editing mode rather than a fallback.

The finding that shapes everything: **a table command rewrites the whole
table.** Obsidian pads every cell to its column's width (minimum three, what
the delimiter needs), adds outer pipes to a table written without them,
fills short rows out with empty cells, and grows the delimiter to match
(`:-----`, `:----:`, `-----:`). So "edit one cell" is never a small diff,
in either app — which is fine for the gate as long as Scoria pads
identically, and `scoria-text/src/table.rs` holds the observed rows as
tests.

The table under the cursor comes from the one Markdown parser, not from
looking for pipes: `BlockKind::Table` already carries the alignments and a
span per cell, so a `|` inside a code span splits a cell here exactly where
it splits one in the reading view. That turned up a real difference:
`` | `a|b` | **bold** | `` has three header cells against a two-cell
delimiter, so GFM — and Scoria's parser — call it a paragraph, while
Obsidian's table editor rewrites it into a three-column table. Scoria does
nothing there rather than turn prose into a table.

The planner is `scoria-text::table`: `tables` and `table_at` (which table,
which cell), `apply` (the text a command writes and where the cursor lands)
and `insert_table`. `TextBuffer::table_command` applies it as one undo step.
The round-trip harness runs eight of the commands over every table in the
corpus and a real vault: nothing outside the table's own bytes moves, and
undo restores the note.

Cells are editable too. Clicking one opens a field in it, the way a
property row's value opens; Tab and Shift+Tab walk the cells, Enter drops
into the cell below, Escape abandons the edit, and the column grows with
what is typed. A table now stays a grid wherever the cursor is, as
Obsidian's `table-editor` does, instead of unfolding to its pipes — Source
mode is where the markdown is edited directly.

A second probe settled what a cell edit writes, which the first had left
open: **ordinary typing re-pads nothing.** A cell changed through the
editor API kept every other byte of the table as it was, through the cursor
moving to another cell and out of the table entirely. So the padded form is
what the commands write, not an invariant, and committing a cell replaces
that cell's bytes and nothing else. Two rules of Scoria's own: a `|` typed
into a cell is written `\|` and a newline becomes a space, because either
would otherwise restructure the table (`table::cell_text`); and a commit
writes nothing unless the cell still holds the bytes the field was opened
on, so a document that moved underneath is left alone.

**Unprobed:** where Obsidian leaves the cursor after each command (the
columns it reported came from an unfocused editor and disagreed with
themselves), whether a column counts characters or display columns for CJK
and emoji — Scoria counts characters — and what Obsidian writes for a `|`
typed into a cell.

### Daily notes, 2026-10-18

`daily-notes` opens today's note, creating it from the configured template
when it is not there; `daily-notes:goto-prev` and `daily-notes:goto-next`
step between the notes that exist. All three are the legacy unprefixed
command ids Obsidian still registers.

The probe settled the three rules that matter:

- **The configured folder has to exist.** Obsidian refuses with
  "Failed to create daily note. Folder “X” not found." and writes nothing,
  rather than creating it — while folders the *format* names
  (`YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD`) are created on the way.
- **An existing note is opened, not rewritten.** The probe's note had a
  byte order mark, CRLF endings and the body "hand written, do not touch";
  its bytes, size and modification time were all the same afterwards.
- **Stepping skips the empty days.** From a note on the 10th with the 9th
  missing, previous is the 2nd and next is the 20th.

Stepping needs the open note's own date, and a moment format cannot be read
backwards — `DD-MM-YYYY` and `YYYY/MM/DD` would each need their own parser.
So `daily_note_day` renders instead: it walks a window of days around today
and takes the one whose rendered path is the path in hand. The same walk
finds the neighbour, which is why a format that does not sort
chronologically still steps correctly. A format Scoria cannot render is
refused outright, because here the format is a path and a wrong one is a
note in the wrong place.

### Driving the app's writes from a test, 2026-10-18

The gate review's other finding was that no test drove a write from the app
to the disk: the harness reaches `scoria-text` and the corpus ratchets
reach `scoria-cache`, but everything the app itself writes went through
`VaultState` or GPUI with nothing exercising the bytes that land.

Four tests close most of it, in the app crate against a temporary vault:
writing a block id reaches the target's bytes and a second write of the
same plan is refused; a CRLF note keeps its endings when an id goes in;
creating a daily note writes the template expanded and leaves the template
itself alone, and a second run finds the note rather than making another;
and a daily note whose folder is missing creates nothing at all.

`Workspace::flush_save` is the one left. It needs a GPUI window, and gpui's
`TestAppContext` is behind a `test-support` feature that pulls a leak
detector and proptest — too much weight for the three lines of IO around a
guard that is itself tested in `scoria-text` and was verified in the
running app with `--stress`. Worth revisiting if the app grows more of
these.

### Line endings and the byte order mark, 2026-10-18

The specification has carried an **Unprobed** note since the reader
milestone: what Obsidian itself writes for a file whose line endings
disagree. It is answered now, and the answer is stronger than the question.

**Obsidian's editor normalizes on save.** Every ending becomes `\n` and a
UTF-8 byte order mark is dropped — not just for a mixed file but for a
uniform CRLF one, which comes back all LF after a single character is
typed. A note that is only *opened* is not touched; the normalization
belongs to the save.

Scoria keeps doing the opposite, deliberately: it writes the file's own
dominant ending and puts the mark back. That means Scoria never introduces
a difference, while a vault used in both apps drifts towards LF with no
mark, driven by Obsidian. Keeping more of the user's file than Obsidian
does is the safe side of this to be on, and it is now a recorded decision
rather than an open question.

The first run of this probe reported that an untouched file *had* been
rewritten. It had not: the probe opened each case in the same leaf, so
opening the next file saved the previous one. Re-running that case alone,
with nothing opened after it, showed the file byte-identical. Worth the
second run.

### A config file with a byte order mark, 2026-10-18

Found while closing the gate gaps, and the same class of loss. A byte order
mark is not JSON, so `serde_json` refused a config file carrying one: every
setting in it read as its default, and the first write replaced the file
wholesale — taking every key Scoria does not model with it. Windows editors
leave such a mark, so this was reachable with no misuse at all.

The mark is now stripped for parsing on both sides and written back on
save, since it is the user's byte and not Scoria's to drop. A file that is
genuinely unparseable is still replaced rather than merged into, which is
the existing documented decision and has its own test; this was never about
that case.

### Adapt to system, and an invented clamp, 2026-10-18

Two bugs found while landing the Settings dropdowns, neither of which
writes a byte, so neither was a gate problem — but the first made a
setting a lie.

`Theme::from_appearance` matched `moonstone` and sent everything else to
the dark theme, so `theme: "system"` — Obsidian's default, and what a vault
with no theme key means — rendered dark forever, while the Settings row
promised "on restart". The scheme now follows the desktop: gpui's
`Window::appearance` answers it, and since the theme global is built before
a window exists, it is rebuilt once there is one.

The other was `base_font_size.clamp(10, 40)`, a range Scoria invented. The
probe settled both halves of it: Obsidian's own slider offers 10 to 30, and
Obsidian neither clamps nor rewrites a file holding something else — 99 sat
in `appearance.json` through a whole session untouched. So the file's value
is honoured, with a floor that only keeps a zero out of the layout, and the
slider's own range is the observed one.

### The save that would not refuse, 2026-10-18

A gate review of every path by which Scoria writes into the vault turned up
the one that loses data, and it is the shape the phase 3 gate is actually
about: a note open and edited in Scoria while Obsidian saves the same note.

`Workspace::flush_save` wrote the whole buffer over the file with no
comparison against what was there, and the watcher deliberately does not
reload a note whose buffer is dirty — it reports "changed on disk; unsaved
edits kept" and returns. So Obsidian's save survived for about two seconds
and was then overwritten by Scoria's autosave, silently.

`TextBuffer` now keeps a fingerprint of the bytes it last knew on disk, set
when a file is loaded and when a save writes one. `flush_save` re-reads the
file first and refuses when it is anything else, keeping the buffer's edits
and saying so. That is the guard `VaultState::write_block_id` already had
for the other note it writes; the save path simply never got one.

Verified in the running app: with `--stress` editing and autosaving a note,
writing the file from a shell and waiting through ten seconds of further
autosaves leaves the shell's bytes on disk. The harness holds the property
over every note of the corpus and a real vault.

**Unprobed:** what Obsidian itself does when it finds a note changed
underneath. Scoria refuses and says so, which loses nothing either way;
merging or writing a conflict copy would be inventing behavior.

### Templates, 2026-10-18

`insert-template` opens a chooser over the template folder's notes — by
basename, sorted, with Obsidian's own `Type name of a template...` — and
writes the chosen one at the cursor with its placeholders filled in.
`insert-current-date` and `insert-current-time` write the same `{{date}}`
and `{{time}}` without a template around them.

What a placeholder does was observed rather than guessed, and the literal
half is the surprising one: `{{DATE}}` expands and `{{ date }}` does not,
`{{date:}}` falls back to the setting, an empty setting falls back to
Obsidian's own default, and nothing is exempt from expansion — not fenced
code, inline code, math or wikilinks. `{{title}}` is the target note's
basename, never its first heading and never a frontmatter `title`. The
whole template the probe expanded is a test in `scoria-templates`, byte
for byte, and so is the moment token table behind the date formats.

`templates.json` holds `folder`, `dateFormat` and `timeFormat`, exists only
once a setting is written, and keeps a cleared field as the empty string
rather than dropping the key; the bytes Obsidian wrote are a round-trip
test in `scoria-vault`. A format token Scoria cannot render is refused with
a message rather than written wrong, which matters more for daily notes,
where the format is a path.

The one new dependency is `chrono`, for the local civil date — it was
already in the tree through gpui, so the lockfile gains an edge and no
crate. `scoria-templates` itself stays clock-free: the instant is passed
in, which is why every test is a fixed date.

### Block references, 2026-10-18

`[[Note#^` lists the target note's blocks, and `[[#^` the blocks of the note
being edited. The query after the `^` matches a block's text or its id,
either way and whatever the case, so `^ara` finds "A paragraph." and
`^BLOCKONE` finds the block with that id. A row shows the block's text with
the `^id` taken off and the id beside it, and accepting one writes the path
exactly as it was typed with no display text — the heading rule — or
`[](Alpha.md#^id)` under `useMarkdownLinks`, with the cursor between the
brackets.

What Obsidian does was observed in the phase 3 probe (see
[[Specification#Observed block reference behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4]]):
the kinds it offers and their labels, how the caret query filters, the
six-lowercase-hex id (180 generated in a row were 180 distinct values), and
the byte-for-byte placement of a written id for a paragraph and a heading.

Every block is offered, and accepting one whose block has no id writes the
id into the *target* note — a write into a file the user never opened,
which is the shape of change the Writer gate exists to catch. The second
probe settled the placement for every kind, and there are only two shapes:
a block whose text ends a line takes ` ^id` inline, and a block that spans
lines takes `^id` on a line of its own with a blank line either side. The
id is six lowercase hex characters that the note does not already use.

The write goes through `VaultState::write_block_id`, which re-reads the
file and refuses unless the bytes are the ones the insertion was planned
against; the watcher then re-indexes it, the same path a save takes. A
block in the note being edited is the load-bearing exception: its id is
folded into the editor's own edit, so one undo takes back the whole accept
and the next save cannot write the id straight back out.

Two things are Scoria's own. Obsidian writes LF newlines into a CRLF note
and leaves it mixed, as it does for properties; Scoria writes the note's
own ending. And a block an id cannot be written onto is refused rather than
written to — `blocks::plan_id` applies the insertion and re-indexes it
before offering it, which the real vault proved necessary: a note whose
code fence is never closed runs to the end of the file, so an id written
after it lands *inside* the fence, indexes as nothing, and would leave a
dangling link in a file that had changed for it.

### Autocompletion, 2026-10-18

Typing `[[`, `![[` or `#` opens a popup over the editor. The rows are the
vault's files, their aliases, a note's headings and the vault's tags;
Enter, Tab and Shift+Enter accept one three different ways.

What Obsidian does here was observed rather than guessed. Its four
`app.workspace.editorSuggest.suggests` instances are drivable from a
throwaway plugin (see [[obsidian-behavior-probes]] in the session notes and
[[#File operations, 2026-10-17]] for the method): `onTrigger` was called for
37 shapes of line, `getSuggestions` for what each offers, and the popup's
own `scope` key handlers for what every accept key writes, across both link
styles, all three `newLinkFormat` values and a source note in a subfolder.
Three runs; the results are written up in
[[Specification#Observed autocompletion behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4]] and
encoded row for row in `scoria-suggest/tests/obsidian_rows.rs`.

What the probes settled that guessing would have got wrong:

- **Tab is not Enter.** Enter finishes the link and leaves the cursor after
  the `]]`; Tab leaves it *inside*, so a `#heading` or `|alias` can follow
  what was just accepted. Shift+Enter ignores the selected row and links the
  text as typed. On a tag, Enter writes a trailing space and Tab does not.
- **A heading pick keeps the path as typed** and never takes display text:
  `[[Sub/Gamma#` stays `Sub/Gamma` where `shortest` would have written
  `Gamma`. Every other pick is reformatted to the vault's `newLinkFormat`.
- **Display text follows the path, not the name.** `|Alpha` is added exactly
  when the path part carries a `/`, and only for notes, so `[[Sub/Alpha|Alpha]]`
  but `[[../pic.png]]`.
- **An empty `[[` is ordered by modification time**, newest first — not by
  recency of opening, which is what the quick switcher uses. The list is also
  files and aliases only: the switcher offers unresolved link targets, this
  does not.
- Nothing suppresses the trigger: it fires inside a code span, a fenced
  block, a `%%comment%%` and frontmatter alike. That is why the trigger is a
  scan back along one line rather than a parse.

The code is a new crate, `scoria-suggest`, free of gpui like `scoria-text`:
`trigger` (what the line asks for), `suggestions` (what the vault offers)
and `insert` (the bytes accepting one writes, reusing
`scoria_cache::links::link_path` so there is one link formatter). The GPUI
side is `scoria/src/suggest.rs`, a list anchored under the query, and about
sixty lines in the editor that hand the popup the keys it owns while it is
open. `VaultFile` grew an `mtime` for the ordering above; the metadata was
already being read for `size`.

The Writer gate's harness covers the new write path: accepting a suggestion
at five places in every corpus note replaces the query and nothing else, and
undoes back to the file's bytes — over the real vault too.

Ranking is Scoria's own fuzzy matcher (the one behind the quick switcher), so
the order within a query can differ from Obsidian's; what each row *writes*
is what matches.

**Not done:** block references. `[[Note#^` offers nothing rather than
offering a row it cannot write, because accepting a block with no id of its
own means writing a six-character id into the *target* note — inline on a
paragraph, on its own line after a heading. That is a write into a second
file and wants its own change. `Ctrl+P`/`Ctrl+N`, which Obsidian's popup also
binds to the selection, are left to Scoria's own bindings.

### Settings sliders and text fields, 2026-10-18

The two sliders write — font size (`baseFontSize`, 10 to 30) and indent
visual width (`tabSize`, 2 to 8) — and so do the two text fields Obsidian
offers as free text: the folder for new notes and the attachment folder
path. Each is the same shape as a dropdown's `Typed`: a key and the one
accessor pair its display is read through and its write goes through, with
a test that walks every one of them for both properties.

The ranges are the ones Obsidian's own controls offer, read off its
rendered tabs in the phase 3 probe. Obsidian neither clamps nor rewrites a
file holding something outside them — 99 sat in `appearance.json` through a
whole session — so the range bounds only what Scoria's control can set, and
a file that already holds something else keeps it.

One behavior is worth the test it got: clearing the attachment folder field
writes the **placeholder**, `Attachments`, not an empty string, while
clearing the new-note folder writes `""`. Both were observed.

The slider is a cell per step rather than a dragged thumb. The ranges are
21 and 7 values wide, so a click lands on a value without measuring the
track, and dragging can come later. The text field is the inline-field
pattern the properties row and the table cell already use, with one
`TextInput` owned by the view rather than by a row: the rows are rebuilt
from the vault on every render, so a row cannot own anything.

**Left read-only, deliberately:** the three font families and spellcheck
languages (Obsidian offers a font picker and a 58-entry select, not free
text, so a text field would be inventing a control), excluded files (a
dialog), accent colour (a colour input), themes (nothing scans
`.obsidian/themes`), and the vault name, vault folder, config folder and
language rows, which are not settings of the vault at all.

### Settings dropdowns, 2026-10-18

Seven dropdowns write: the base colour scheme, the default view for new
tabs, the default editing mode, properties in document, where new notes go,
the new link format and what happens to a deleted file. Clicking one shows
its options and picking one writes the key.

A dropdown is a `Typed`: the key, the option list, and the one pair of
accessors the control's label is read through and a pick is written
through. That is the same guarantee the toggles' `Flag` gives — a row
cannot show one key and write another — and it let the seven hand-written
label matches go, since the table now owns both directions. Two tests walk
every dropdown: one asserts a pick writes its own key and nothing else,
the other writes each option, reloads the vault and asserts the control
reads that option back.

The values came from the phase 3 probe, which also settled the question
this work was waiting on: **a setting at its default is written, not
removed**, for every kind of value. So `Vault::write_config` needed no way
of removing a key, which is what the research had flagged as the one answer
that could have forced a change there.

`livePreview` is the odd one: a two-option dropdown over a boolean key, so
it reads and writes `true` and `false` as the strings its options name
rather than getting a mechanism of its own.

The options are drawn with `deferred`, the way the file explorer's context
menu is. Without it the rows below paint over the open menu, because a
later sibling wins — this version of gpui has no `z_index`.

**Unprobed:** the option labels are Scoria's existing ones, read off
Obsidian's settings tab when the read-only modal was built, not re-observed
in the phase 3 run — that run drove the config keys rather than the
controls, so it settled what is written and not what the tab reads.

### Settings writing, 2026-10-18

Every toggle in the Settings modal writes. A click clones the config the
control reads, flips its one field and emits it; `Workspace::change_setting`
writes the file through `Vault::write_config` — which merges into the file's
own JSON, so only that key moves — stores it in the `VaultState` and pushes
what the running app can change into the open views. The banner now says
which controls write; dropdowns, text fields and sliders are still read-only.

What a toggle writes is a `Flag`: the key Obsidian writes, what the key
means when it is absent, and the accessors for it. The control's state is
read through the same flag that a click writes, so the two cannot drift
apart, and a test walks every flag of every file to check that toggling
writes that key, flips it, and touches nothing else. The one control
Obsidian words backwards ("Use [[Wikilinks]]" is `useMarkdownLinks`
negated) carries an `invert` bit rather than its own code path.

The config a toggle changes has to be mutable while the vault is open, so
`app`, `appearance`, `core_plugins`, `community_plugins` and `switcher` moved
behind locks in `VaultState`, as `property_types` already was, and are read
through accessors.

Applied on the spot, from `Workspace::apply_app_config`: readable line
length, smart lists, indent with tabs or spaces, properties in document and
strict line breaks (the editor rebuilds its widgets), plus show-all-file-types
in Files. The rest (inline title, folding, line numbers, RTL, spellcheck,
auto-pairing, Vim mode, native menus, the ribbon, tab title bars) is written
for Obsidian to honor; Scoria does not implement those yet.

Which is which is now on the row. Every item carries an `Honored`: nothing
on a setting Scoria follows as you click it, "on restart" for the theme and
the fonts (the `Theme` global is built once from `appearance.json` at
startup), and "not in Scoria yet" for everything written only for Obsidian
to read — the whole Core plugins tab included, since Scoria's own Files,
Search and Graph do not turn off with the plugins that own them in Obsidian.
The vault is shared, so writing a setting Scoria ignores is worth doing;
letting a click look like it changed something here is not. A test walks
every tab and asserts that exactly seven toggles go untagged, so
implementing one of the tagged settings means dropping its tag in the same
change.

Two rules came out of the shapes of the files themselves rather than a probe:
a vault with no `core-plugins.json` gets a whole map of every plugin at its
default, because a one-key file would read as "everything else off", and the
legacy array shape keeps its shape.

The question this note used to leave open — whether Obsidian removes a key
when a setting goes back to its default — was settled by the phase 3 probe:
it does not. Every default-valued write kept its key with the explicit
value, so what Scoria already writes is what Obsidian writes, and no way of
removing a config key is needed. See
[[Specification#Observed settings write behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4]].

### Round-trip harness, 2026-10-18

The Writer gate — the vault round-trips byte-identical after a week of mixed
use — now has a harness:
`crates/scoria-text/tests/writer_roundtrip.rs`, over the 1000-note corpus and
both `.obsidian` sets in the repository. Four properties, one per shape of
writing:

- opening a note and saving it changes no bytes;
- every editing command undoes back to the file's bytes (a scripted session
  of typing, Enter, Tab, Shift+Tab, Backspace, Delete, Ctrl+Backspace,
  paste, typing over a selection and cutting a line, at five places in every
  note, wound all the way back);
- an edit is local: typing changes the bytes at the cursor and nothing else,
  and a property write stays inside its block;
- a config file read and written back is unchanged.

Invariants are checked after every step, not just at the end: the line index
is the one the text implies, every cursor sits on a character boundary, and
what a save would write reads back as the text in hand. Setting
`SCORIA_ROUNDTRIP_VAULT` to a vault's path runs the same round trips over it
(nothing is written — the edits happen in a buffer in memory), which is how
the gate's real vault is checked without a test depending on one.

To make the editor testable the text model moved out of the GPUI view into
`crates/scoria-text`: `TextBuffer` (the text, its line index, the selections,
the undo history and one method per editing command), `FileText`, the
`lists`, `find` and edit-plan modules, all free of gpui.
`crates/scoria/src/editor.rs` keeps the shaping, scrolling, decorations, find
panel and properties table and holds a `TextBuffer`; its actions are now
`buf.<command>()` followed by `after_edit`. Nothing changed in behavior —
the suite and a 400-step stress run on a 20k-line note are the evidence.

Writing the harness found three bugs on the spot:

- **A stray `\r\n` rewrote a whole file.** `FileText` took any `\r\n` as
  "this file uses CRLF", so a note from a real vault with one such line
  among 4430 Unix ones would have had every line ending rewritten by the
  first save. The ending is now the dominant one, and a file whose endings
  disagree is kept verbatim and written back unchanged until it is edited.
- **`core-plugins.json` and `hotkeys.json` were sorted maps.** Obsidian
  writes both in its own order, so the first save would have reordered every
  line. Both are `IndexMap` now, like `types.json`.
- **A struct cannot reproduce a config file.** Serializing `GraphConfig`
  gave Obsidian's `graph.json` back with its keys in declaration order, `1.0`
  where the file said `1`, `0.51871324` where it said `0.518713248970312`
  (an `f32` field) and no `colorGroups` at all (skipped when empty).
  `Vault::write_config` now merges the new value into the file's own JSON:
  a key whose value did not change keeps its bytes and its place, a changed
  one is replaced where it stands, a new one is appended, and a key the type
  does not serialize is left alone.

Not covered here, by design: link rewriting on rename
(`scoria-cache/tests/rename_corpus.rs`) and the properties planner
(`scoria-cache/tests/properties_corpus.rs`) have their own corpus ratchets;
this harness drives the writer's path into them rather than their internals.

### Properties, 2026-10-18

The frontmatter block is now a typed, editable properties table in Live
Preview and a read-only one in the reading view.
`scoria-formats::properties` is the model: it scans the YAML into ordered
entries with byte spans, reads each value with `serde_yaml`, infers types,
serializes values the way Obsidian writes them, and plans edits as byte
ranges. `scoria-cache::note_properties` is the one place that joins it to
`extract_frontmatter`. `scoria::properties` turns entries into display rows
and holds the field-editing rules as pure functions; `scoria::reading::view`
draws the rows (read-only, or editable when Live Preview passes a
`PropertiesHost`) and `scoria::editor` owns the open field, routes keys into
it and applies a commit.

The rules came from Obsidian 1.14.4 directly, with the same throwaway-plugin
method as the file operations: `scoria-probe` in a scratch vault drove
`processFrontMatter` through about forty scenarios, dumped
`registeredTypeWidgets` and the inferred and assigned type of every value
shape, ran the three property commands, and read every file back byte for
byte. What it showed is listed in [[Specification#Observed properties behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4]] and encoded in the tests. The headline:

- Obsidian rewrites the **whole** block on any property write. A
  `processFrontMatter` call that mutates nothing still deletes YAML comments,
  turns `tags: [one, two]` into a block sequence and drops blank lines. A
  block already in that canonical form round-trips byte-identical.
- So Scoria writes Obsidian's canonical form, but only for the entries whose
  value actually changes. `plan` compares *values*, not rendered text, which
  is what keeps a flow sequence and its quoting when the value is unchanged;
  everything else in the block keeps its bytes.

`crates/scoria-cache/tests/properties_corpus.rs` is the ratchet over the
1005 corpus notes that have frontmatter: rewriting every value with itself
plans no edit, every entry span really covers its key and stays inside the
block, a real edit leaves the bytes before and after the entry identical,
clearing leaves exactly the body (plus a BOM where there is one), and adding
a property appends one line and reorders nothing. Writing the ratchet found
two bugs on the spot: bare dates were being quoted on rewrite, and an
unchanged flow list was being reflowed.

The UI: a foldable "Properties" heading, then a row per property with its
type glyph, key and value. Lists, tags and aliases draw as pills; a
wikilink value draws as the link (its alias, or the target without a
subpath) and follows on click; a tag item is clickable whether or not it is
written with `#`; a checkbox draws a box; an empty value shows a
placeholder; a value that does not fit its type is marked and kept as
written. In Live Preview a click on a key or value opens a field — the
editor routes typing, the arrows, Home, End, Backspace and Delete into it,
Enter commits, Tab commits a key and moves to its value, Escape abandons —
and a commit is one undo step through `apply_edits`. The row icon opens the
type menu, the `×` removes the property, `+ Add property` opens an unnamed
row that writes nothing until it is named. The three commands
(`markdown:add-metadata-property`, `markdown:clear-metadata-properties`,
`editor:toggle-fold-properties`) are runnable, and `propertiesInDocument`
picks the table, nothing or the raw YAML.

Choosing a type writes `.obsidian/types.json`, the first config file Scoria
writes: `Vault::write_config` serializes with two-space indentation and no
trailing newline, as Obsidian does, and `PropertyTypes` keeps insertion order
(an `IndexMap`) and its unknown keys so the file does not churn.

Two parser corrections fell out of the probe. YAML's `...` does not close a
properties block in Obsidian, and no longer does in `extract_frontmatter`.
Obsidian also does not recognise frontmatter after a byte order mark and
prepends a second block when a property is added; Scoria keeps reading
through the BOM and edits the block in place, which is a deliberate
divergence from a case where Obsidian loses the original block. Obsidian
likewise leaves mixed line endings when it writes into a CRLF block; Scoria
writes the file's own ending.

Not yet: editing properties in the reading view (Obsidian allows it there
too), drag-to-reorder, a calendar picker for `date` and `datetime`, value
autocompletion from other notes, and the Properties core-plugin side panes
(`properties:open`, `properties:open-local`).

### File operations, 2026-10-17

New note (Ctrl+N, `file-explorer:new-file`, the Files menu, a click on a
link nobody has created, Enter in the switcher), new folder, rename (F2,
`workspace:edit-file-title`), move (`file-explorer:move-file`, a fuzzy
folder picker), make a copy, and delete (`app:delete-file`) exist, each
through a small prompt modal (`crates/scoria/src/prompt.rs`) or the
explorer's right-click menu. `scoria-vault::ops` does the disk work and
updates the file and folder lists (the vault now tracks folders, so empty
ones show in Files); `scoria-cache::links` plans the link rewrites;
`VaultState` in `workspace.rs` runs both and brings the index up to date
before the watcher's events arrive (they then find nothing to change).

The rules were taken from Obsidian 1.14.4 directly: a throwaway plugin in a
scratch vault (`scoria-probe`, kept in the session's scratch space, not the
repository) renamed files through `fileManager.renameFile` under every
`newLinkFormat`, resolved links through `getFirstLinkpathDest`, created and
trashed files, and dumped the resulting notes. What it showed, now encoded
in the two modules' tests:

- Every link that resolved to the renamed file is regenerated with the
  vault's `newLinkFormat` whatever form it had (`[[a]]`, `[[A.md]]`,
  `[[Sub/A]]`, `[A](./A.md)`, `[A](/A.md)` all become `[[A2]]` or
  `[A2](A2.md)`); a link whose written path already matches is left byte
  for byte, so moving a note with a unique name changes nothing. Shortest
  format falls back to the full path when the basename is ambiguous.
- The style survives: wikilink or markdown, embed or link, angle-bracketed
  destination or not. Markdown destinations keep `.md` and encode only
  spaces (`Ä%20(b)%20100%.md`). The subpath is kept; the alias is kept
  verbatim, except that an alias equal to the old basename and different
  from the written path follows the new basename (`[[Sub/S|S]]` becomes
  `[[S2|S2]]`, `[[S|S]]` becomes `[[S2|S]]`). A markdown link's text follows
  the new basename when it was the old one, or the new link path when it was
  the old destination without `.md`.
- Code spans and fenced code are untouched; reference-style links and their
  definitions are not updated; `[[#Heading]]` self links are not touched.
- Links inside a moved note are regenerated only when they would stop
  resolving (`[B](../B.md)` after the note moved into a subfolder).
- Frontmatter links update. Obsidian re-serializes the whole YAML block when
  it does (`aliases: [Bee]` became a block list); Scoria replaces the link
  text in place instead, keeping the file's bytes.
- `newFileLocation`: a new note is `Untitled.md`, `Untitled 1.md`, ... at
  the root, in the open note's folder, or in `newFileFolderPath` (falling
  back to the root when that folder is missing); a `folder/Name` link
  creates the folders. Creating over an existing path fails with "File
  already exists.", renaming onto one with "Destination file already
  exists!"; a case-only rename succeeds.
- `trashOption` defaults to `system` (freedesktop trash on Linux, with a
  `.trashinfo` record; the vault's `.trash` is the fallback elsewhere);
  `local` moves a file flat into `.trash/` and a folder with its contents,
  numbering collisions ` 2`, ` 3`. `promptDelete` defaults to on.
- `alwaysUpdateLinks` defaults to on; off asks first ("Update links?" with a
  "Don't update" button), as Obsidian's dialog does.

The same probe corrected link resolution: with duplicate basenames Obsidian
picks a file at the vault root first, then one in the source's own folder,
then the shortest path, then path order (`[[Zed]]` from `Long/Way/Down/C.md`
is `Zed.md`, not the sibling `Long/Way/Down/Zed.md`; `[[X]]` there is the
sibling `Long/Way/Down/X.md` over `Mid/X.md`). `./` and `../` paths resolve
relative to the source only, `/path` from the root only. The spec's
"same folder first" rule was wrong and is fixed in [[Specification]].

`crates/scoria-cache/tests/rename_corpus.rs` renames every note of the
1000-note corpus, moves its folders under every format and renames its
attachments, and checks that every resolved link still resolves to the same
file, no link appears or disappears, and nothing outside the links changes.
Not yet: drag and drop in Files, inline title editing, attachment
pasting, the system trash on Windows and macOS.

### Reader gate, 2026-10-16

Checked against a real 10-note vault (project notes with wikilinks and
aliases, tables in nine of them, fenced ASCII diagrams, inline code, ordered
and bulleted lists, two `.canvas` files) by opening every note and the lower
sections of the long ones. Every block rendered with its content; backlinks,
outgoing links and unlinked mentions matched the text. Two fidelity bugs
found and fixed on the way: table columns were all equal, which broke long
identifiers mid-word (columns now follow HTML's automatic table layout, see
below), and fenced code wider than the note wrapped instead of scrolling.

Still not rendered, none of it present in that vault: MathJax (math shows as
its source), HTML tags (shown as text), remote images, Canvas and Bases
files (Parity phase), and the local graph beyond depth one.

### Command palette and Settings, 2026-10-16

`scoria-commands` now carries the command names (`data/names.txt`) and
default hotkeys as Obsidian 1.14.4 registers them, captured from the running
app with a throwaway plugin that dumped `app.commands` and the settings
tabs; the ids gained the nineteen 1.14.4 additions. `CommandRegistry`
keeps registration order, applies `hotkeys.json` (an entry replaces the
defaults, an empty list unbinds) and turns a binding into a label
(`Ctrl + Shift + F`) or a GPUI keystroke. At startup the workspace binds a
`RunCommand { id }` action for every command it can run, so the shell has
no hard-coded shortcuts left; `Workspace::run_command` dispatches by id.

The palette (`crates/scoria/src/palette.rs`) shows only runnable commands,
the way Obsidian hides commands whose check callback fails: palette,
switcher, search, graph and local graph, reading view toggle, back and
forward, settings, sidebar toggles, Files, reveal, Backlinks, Outgoing
links, Outline and Tags. Everything else stays visible in the Hotkeys tab.

Settings (`crates/scoria/src/settings.rs`) is a modal with Obsidian's
navigation and setting rows (name, description, control). Controls are
drawn in their current state from `app.json`, `appearance.json`,
`core-plugins.json`, `community-plugins.json` and the plugin manifests,
`switcher.json` and `command-palette.json`; the Hotkeys tab filters all,
assigned, unassigned and assigned-by-me over the registry and marks custom
bindings. A banner says the view is read-only; writing settings waits for
the writer milestone because Obsidian rewrites the whole file on every
change. Not shown: settings whose `app.json` key is unobserved (default file
to open, delete attachments, Mermaid, quick font size, zoom, frame style,
URI callbacks), the Keychain tab, and options of other core plugins.

### Reading view, 2026-10-16

`crates/scoria/src/reading/model.rs` turns the parser tree into an owned
render tree (styled runs with clickable ranges, resolved embeds, footnotes in
reference order, frontmatter as properties); `view.rs` draws it with a lazily
measured `list`, one item per top-level block, so a 50k-line note lays out
only what is on screen. Clicks on wikilinks, markdown links, tags and footnote
references go back to the workspace, which resolves them with the vault
cache: `[[Note#Heading]]` and `[[Note#^id]]` scroll to the target block.

Rendered: headings, paragraphs with soft breaks, emphasis, strong, strike,
highlight, inline code, inline math (raw), tags, images (`![[pic.png|200x100]]`
sizes), embedded notes, sections and blocks to a depth of four, lists with
numbers and task checkboxes, block quotes, callouts with fold state and
Obsidian's type colors, tables with column alignment, code blocks with a
language label, display math (raw), raw HTML (as text), footnotes.

Tables lay their columns out the way an HTML table's automatic layout does:
each column wants its widest cell and needs at least its longest word (both
measured with the real font), the table is as wide as the sum when that
fits the note, and otherwise the slack between minimum and wish is shared
in proportion. The view records its painted width for this and re-lays out
when it changes. Code blocks never wrap; long lines scroll sideways.

Not yet: Live Preview, MathJax, HTML rendering, remote images, checkbox
toggling, heading folding, copy buttons, PDF export.

### Graph view, 2026-10-16

`crates/scoria/src/graph/layout.rs` is the force simulation: Barnes-Hut
repulsion over a quadtree, springs along links at `linkDistance`, a weak
pull to the center, simulated annealing that stops when cool; drags reheat
it. `view.rs` builds nodes and edges from the cache on the background
executor (notes, optional attachments, unresolved targets and tags, orphans
on or off, the `search` filter and `colorGroups` from `graph.json` evaluated
with the search grammar), steps the layout in the background, and paints
through a canvas: one stroked path for the edges, circles for nodes, labels
once zoomed past a threshold that grows with node count. The local graph
keeps the current note and its depth-1 neighbors; opening another note
re-centers it. The view auto-fits until the user zooms or pans.

Not yet: depth beyond one and the local-graph side pane, arrows, the
timelapse animation, screenshot export, writing display changes back to
`graph.json`.

### File watching and mentions, 2026-10-16

`notify` watches the vault root; the workspace drains the event channel every
300 ms, so a burst of writes becomes one batch. `Vault::refresh_path` turns
each path into added, modified or removed files (walking a moved-in folder,
dropping everything under a removed one, ignoring dot-folders), then
`VaultState::apply` re-reads and re-indexes the notes among them under write
locks and calls `MetadataCache::reresolve` when files appeared or vanished,
because links elsewhere may now resolve. Unlinked mentions use one regex
alternation over every note name and alias (`mentions::Finder`), skipping
matches inside wikilinks, markdown links, inline code and fenced code.

### Bookmarks, 2026-10-20

The Bookmarks core plugin, from the same probe run as the tab groups
([[Specification#Observed bookmarks behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4 (installer build 1.13.7)]]).
`scoria-formats::bookmarks` reads `bookmarks.json` keeping every item as the
JSON object it was — so an item Scoria never touched is written back key for
key, unknown keys included — and lays out the items Scoria makes in
Obsidian's order (`type`, `ctime`, then `path`/`subpath`, `query`, `title`
and `options`, or `items` then `title` for a group). The vault writes the
file whole, two-space indented, no trailing newline, as observed; the
observed file is a round-trip test.

The pane is a third tab of the left dock, shown while `core-plugins.json`
leaves the plugin on: the header's first three buttons ("Bookmark the
active tab...", "New group", "Collapse all" — the search filter is not
built), one row per item with a glyph per kind, groups folding, the open
note's row marked, a right-click "Remove". A file row opens the note at its
heading or block, a search row fills the Search pane, a graph row opens the
graph, a folder row shows the folder in Files, a url row opens the browser.
`workspace.json`'s left dock restores to it when its `currentTab` is the
`bookmarks` leaf.

The commands: `bookmarks:open`; `bookmark-current-view` (the note, or the
graph with the whole option document of `graph.json`; a note already
bookmarked opens "Edit bookmark" whose Remove takes it out);
`bookmark-current-heading` and `bookmark-current-section` (the block id
written into the buffer as one edit when the block has none, exactly as the
link suggester writes one); `bookmark-current-search`;
`bookmark-all-tabs` (a group of every tab in every group, each member
stamped with one time, the title defaulting to the moment in Obsidian's
`MMMM D, YYYY h:mm A`); and `unbookmark-current-view`, which removes the
plain file item added last, groups included, as Obsidian's lookup by path
does. Each goes through the same prompt as a rename, "Add bookmark", with
the default name as the Title field's placeholder; the Files menu gained
"Bookmark..." for files and folders.

Checked over the control socket in the scratch vault: each command's file
after Enter matched the probe's bytes shape for shape, `bookmark-current-section`
wrote ` ^caceeb` onto the paragraph and the autosave saved it, the pane
listed the items with the open note marked, and clicking the block row
opened A at the block.

### Tab groups, 2026-10-20

The main area was one strip of tabs over one editor and one reading view;
`workspace.json`'s `main` was flattened into it on read and left alone on
write when it held more than one group. It is now a tree. `Layout` is the
tree Obsidian's `main` records — a root `split` over `tabs` groups and nested
splits — and every `TabGroup` owns an editor and a reading view of its own, so
two groups show two notes at once. The active group's tabs and note stay in
the workspace's live fields, exactly as the active tab's always did, and
switching groups stashes them and loads the other's without reloading a
file: the group's views already show its note. A mouse down anywhere in a
group makes it active before the view handles the click, so an edit always
lands in the live editor and the autosave, the explorer highlight, the graph
centre and the right dock all follow.

What was built, each from the probe run of the same day
([[Specification#Observed tab group behavior, Obsidian 1.14.4 (installer build 1.13.7)]]):
`workspace:split-vertical` and `split-horizontal` (a sibling when the
enclosing split runs that way, a wrapping split otherwise, the new group a
copy of the active leaf and active); `editor:focus-left/right/top/bottom`
(the sibling on that side, and inside it the most recently used group);
`workspace:close-tab-group`, `close-others-tab-group` (the group's other
tabs, as Obsidian's), and a group's last tab closing the group with focus
going to the most recently used group left; `editor:open-link-in-new-split`;
a draggable divider between every pair of children that writes Obsidian's
`dimension` percentages on both, halved by a split and rescaled to a hundred
by a close; and `main` read as a tree and written back as one, each node
over the keys it was read with, so a nested layout Obsidian wrote comes back
to it byte for byte. The socket's `state` gained a `groups` object (active
id, the tree, every group's tabs and dimension), and its `mouse` `move`
takes a `button` so a divider can be dragged from a script.

Two limits worth knowing. There is one graph view: the group that shows it
is the active one when that is in graph mode, else the first that is, and a
second group asking for the graph says so in its place. And a leaf type
Scoria has no view for is still dropped on read, as before.

Checked on the desktop over the control socket in a scratch vault: split
right, open B, split down, click back into the left group, focus-right
landing on the bottom-right group, close-tab-group taking the group away,
quit writing the nested `main` with `active` on the right leaf, and a
relaunch bringing all three groups back with C in reading view. `cargo test
-p scoria` has four new tests for reading `main`, splitting, removing,
neighbours and the `dimension` slot.

### Search and quick switcher, 2026-10-16

`crates/scoria-search` implements the query grammar once: implicit AND,
uppercase `OR`, parentheses, `-` negation, quoted phrases with `\"`,
`/regex/flags`, the `file:` `path:` `content:` `tag:` `line:` `block:`
`section:` `task:` `task-todo:` `task-done:` `match-case:` `ignore-case:`
operators, and `[prop]`, `[prop:value]`, `[prop:null]`, `[prop:true]`,
`[prop:>n]` properties. `Query::explain` prints the tree with the labels
Obsidian's "Explain search terms" shows, which the tests check. Matching is
regex-based (case-insensitive unless `match-case:`) and returns byte ranges
for highlighting; scoped operators evaluate per line, block, section or task.
The Search tab runs the compiled query over the indexed note texts on the
background executor with rayon and lists results per file. The fuzzy scorer
(`fuzzy_match`) rewards word starts, consecutive runs and short candidates;
the switcher ranks file names, aliases and paths with it. The text field is a
single-line `TextInput` painted through a canvas element with GPUI's input
handler, so IME works.

> [!note] Fonts
> The pinned gpui does not pick weights out of a variable font, so with Noto
> Sans (one `NotoSans.ttf` for every weight) nothing renders bold. The default
> text and interface font is Liberation Sans, which ships static Bold faces;
> `appearance.json` fonts override it.

## Spike gates

The [[Specification]] sets three gates before any reader or writer work starts.

| Gate | Target | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Editor prototype | 50k-line note with wikilink and heading decorations | passed, see below |
| Parser conformance | 1000-note HTML diff corpus at 99 percent | passed: 1007/1009 notes against Obsidian 1.13.7, plus CommonMark 652/652 |
| Index performance | 20k-file vault indexed cold in under 2 s | measured, see below |

### Source editor, 2026-10-16

`crates/scoria/src/editor.rs` is a plain-text Markdown editor over one `String`
with a line index. A custom GPUI element shapes and paints only the visible
lines; decorations come from `scoria_markdown::highlight`, recomputed on a
background thread after each edit (one parse in flight, one queued) and
swapped in when ready, so typing never waits for the parser. Input goes
through GPUI's input handler scoped to the cursor line, so IME composition
works; everything else is an action.

Grown from the spike prototype the same day: soft wrap at the view width
(capped at the readable line length and centered, like Obsidian), a
selection (shift with every movement key, drag, double-click word,
triple-click line, Ctrl+A), word movement and deletion, undo and redo with
CodeMirror's grouping (consecutive typing or deleting within half a second
is one step), clipboard copy, cut and paste (the whole line when nothing is
selected), and the note's text font with the monospace font for code. The
scroll position is a line plus a pixel offset into it rather than an
absolute pixel, so wrapped-row heights are only measured near the viewport
and a 50k-line note never needs a full layout pass; Page Up and Down,
revealing the cursor and clamping at the end all walk rows from that anchor.

Saving: the buffer holds `\n`; the file's BOM and `\r\n` endings are
remembered at load and put back on write, so a save changes nothing but the
edited bytes (verified with `--stress` on a BOM-and-CRLF note in a scratch
vault). Edits save two seconds after the last keystroke, on Ctrl+S
(`editor:save-file`), when another note opens, when the view switches to
reading mode (which then rebuilds from the saved text), and when the window
closes. The watcher's reload of the open note is skipped when the file is
what the editor last wrote, keeps the cursor when the note changed
underneath an unedited buffer, and leaves unsaved edits alone otherwise.

```
cargo run --release -p scoria -- docs/scoria --synthetic 50000          # open a generated 50k-line note
cargo run --release -p scoria -- docs/scoria --synthetic 50000 --stress  # 600 self-driven edits, then a report
```

Stress run on the reference machine with soft wrap on, 50,001 lines (4.3 MB,
244k decorated spans; the synthetic note is far denser in syntax than a real
one):

| Measure | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Frames painted during 600 edit, selection, undo and navigation steps in 7 s | 607 |
| Shaping the visible lines, per frame | 0.17 ms mean, 1.95 ms max |
| Full reparse plus decoration pass (background) | 222 ms mean |
| Edit to refreshed decorations | 244 ms |

The frame path is the gate: scrolling and typing stay far under a frame
budget regardless of note size. Decoration latency scales with note length
because the whole note is reparsed; a real 50k-line note of ordinary prose is
about half this size, and incremental reparse of the edited block is the
planned follow-up. Not yet: auto-pair of brackets and markdown markers, and
Ctrl+click page previews.

### Find and replace, 2026-10-16

Ctrl+F (`editor:open-search`) opens Obsidian's search panel at the top
right of the editor, switching to editing first; Ctrl+H
(`editor:open-search-replace`) adds the replace row, which a toggle on the
panel also shows. The query starts as the selection when it sits on one
line. Matching is case-insensitive and literal (`crates/scoria/src/find.rs`,
capped at 20k matches); every match is tinted, the selected one more so,
and the panel counts them. Typing selects the first match from the cursor
on, Enter and the arrows step forward and back with wrap-around, Enter in
the replace field or the Replace button replaces the selected match and
steps on, Replace all does every match in one undo step, Escape closes.
Matches refresh after every edit. `--find q` opens a note with the panel
up, for screenshots.

### Smart lists and the scrollbar, 2026-10-16

Enter with `smartIndentList` continues what the line started: its quote
markers, its bullet or the next number, and an empty checkbox after a task;
the rest of a split item moves to the new line and the ordered items that
follow renumber in the same undo step. Enter on an empty item clears it, or
outdents it when nested. Shift+Enter is a plain newline. Tab indents a list
item (or every selected line) by one step, a tab or `tabSize` spaces per
`useTab`, and Shift+Tab removes one. `crates/scoria/src/lists.rs` holds the
prefix parser and the rules as pure functions with tests.

The vertical scrollbar is line-based like the scroll position: the thumb
sits at the first visible line's share of the note and is as tall as the
visible lines' share, so it never needs the height of every line. Dragging
it or clicking the track scrolls to that line.

### Live Preview, 2026-10-16

Live Preview is the same editor and buffer with a per-line display
transform (`crates/scoria/src/preview.rs`): from the line's highlight spans
it hides markers or substitutes glyphs, and returns the display text with a
piece map between source and display offsets. Every construct the cursor
or selection touches keeps its source, so a line's markers appear as the
cursor enters them and go when it leaves, per construct rather than per
line, as in Obsidian. The editor shapes the display text and maps clicks,
the cursor, the selection and IME bounds through the pieces; Source mode is
the identity transform.

Rendered today: heading markers hidden and the line scaled (Obsidian's h1
to h6 sizes at a tighter line height, so rows now have per-line heights
and all scroll math walks those), bold, italic, strikethrough, highlight and
inline code markers, wikilinks shown as their alias or target, markdown
links and images as their text, autolink brackets, footnote brackets,
comments and block ids hidden, bullets as dots, task markers as checkboxes
(click toggles them without moving the cursor), quote markers as a left bar
per level, callout type blocks folded into the title, thematic breaks as a
rule, and code blocks and frontmatter on a band. Clicking a rendered link
follows it (Ctrl+click in both editing modes). Tables, embeds, images and
math showed their source with decorations until the widgets below.

`crates/scoria-markdown::highlight` gained a `QuoteMarker` span per `>` so
the transform knows where each level's marker sits. The 300-step stress run
on a 530-line note in Live Preview shaped in 0.07 ms per frame; the 50k-line
Source mode gate is unchanged at 0.17 ms.

### Regex search, multiple cursors and block widgets, 2026-10-17

The find panel gained Obsidian's two toggles, `Aa` (match case) and `.*`
(regex), both off by default; `crates/scoria/src/find.rs` now compiles the
query with the `regex` crate (a literal query is escaped), skips empty
matches and treats a pattern that does not parse as no results. A regex
replacement expands `$&`, `$1` to `$9` and `$$`. Find all (the button, or
Alt+Enter in the query) turns every match into a selection, closes the panel
and focuses the editor.

The editor keeps extra selections beside the primary one (`extra`, sorted and
disjoint); `cursors()` and `set_cursors()` move between that and a plain
list, merging selections that overlap. Typing, Backspace, Delete, word
deletion, Enter (a plain newline when there are several cursors), Tab, cut,
copy and paste go through `edit_all`, one replacement per selection in one
undo step; the history records the selections either side, so undo restores
all cursors, and a typing step joins the previous group when it starts
exactly where that one ended. Movement runs the same per-cursor target
function for every selection; `add_cursor` (the `editor:add-cursor-above`
and `below` commands) puts one a row above the topmost or below the
bottommost, Alt+click adds or removes one, Escape and a plain click
collapse to the primary. The status bar counts cursors. IME composition
still addresses the primary cursor only; the others are shifted past its
edit.

Tab and Shift+Tab with smart lists on now renumber: `lists::renumber_block`
walks the list block around the changed lines and gives every ordered item
from the first changed line down its previous sibling's number plus one,
or 1 when it has none (so an indented item starts a nested list at 1 and
the items it left behind close the gap). The edits are planned in pre-edit
coordinates (`indent_plan`) so the indentation and the new numbers are one
undo step.

Live Preview renders tables, math blocks and embed-only paragraphs as
widgets. The background parse also builds them (`reading::model::build_widgets`,
with the vault as embed source, so embedded notes and images resolve), and
the editor folds a widget's lines into one entry whose height is the
rendered element's; `height_of` returns that height for the first line and
zero for the rest, so the scroll math is unchanged. The widget element
comes from the reading view's `Renderer`, which no longer depends on the
`ReadingView` entity but takes link and fold handlers, and is laid out as a
child element inside the editor's custom element (the editor entity is
leased for the frame so the app is at hand). Any selection touching the
block unfolds it: arrowing into a table or math block shows its source, as
does clicking one (at the clicked row); an embed widget keeps its clicks so
links inside work. Inline math drops its dollars like other inline markers.
Math is shown as its TeX source, centered and in the accent color, as in the
reading view; there is no formula renderer yet. `--find-all q` opens a note
with every match selected, for screenshots.

### Parser, 2026-10-16

`scoria-markdown` now parses CommonMark, GFM tables, strikethrough, task lists,
footnotes and bare URLs, and Obsidian's wikilinks, embeds, tags, block ids,
callouts, highlights, comments and math into one tree with byte spans. All 652
examples of the CommonMark 0.31.2 spec render byte-identical HTML
(`tests/commonmark.rs`, a ratchet that must not go down).

The Obsidian side of the gate is `tests/corpus.rs`: `tests/corpus/vault` is a
vault of 1000 generated notes (`scoria-bench generate --notes 1000`) and nine
hand-written edge-case notes, and `tests/corpus/expected` holds the HTML
Obsidian 1.13.7 produced for each through the `scoria-corpus` plugin that
ships inside the vault. Both sides are reduced to a canonical token stream
(no copy buttons, icons, MathJax output or `dir` attributes) before
comparison. 1007 of 1009 notes match; the two left are pathological
delimiter runs and a wikilink inside markdown link text. The observed
behaviors are listed in [[Specification]].

To regenerate the expected HTML after changing the corpus: set the corpus
vault as the open vault in `~/.config/obsidian/obsidian.json` (or open it from
Obsidian's vault switcher), create an empty `.scoria-autorun` file in the vault,
start Obsidian, and trust the plugin when asked the first time. The plugin
writes `../expected`, then closes its window.

### Index benchmark, 2026-10-15

Synthetic vault from `scoria-bench generate`: 20,000 notes, 2,000 attachments, 35 MB of Markdown.
Page cache was warm; cold numbers need the cache dropped first.

| Threads | Scan | Read | Index | Resolve | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 78 ms | 46 ms | 24 ms | 32 ms | 180 ms |
| 1 | 77 ms | 144 ms | 369 ms | 137 ms | 726 ms |

Folder scanning is the largest fixed cost and the stage to watch as the indexer grows.

### Index benchmark, 2026-10-16

Same vault, with the cache built from the full parser tree instead of a line
scanner. Warm page cache.

| Threads | Scan | Read | Index | Resolve | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 128 | 75 ms | 19 ms | 11 ms | 34 ms | 139 ms |
| 1 | 76 ms | 116 ms | 563 ms | 140 ms | 895 ms |

The full parser costs about 200 ms more than the old line scanner on one
thread (35 MB in 563 ms, roughly 60 MB/s) and is invisible with the thread
pool. The gate still passes cold with margin; the parser is not the bottleneck.
