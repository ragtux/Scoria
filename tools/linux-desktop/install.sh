# A Linux desktop keeps an application's icon in neither the executable nor a bundle but in the
# icon theme, looked up by the `Icon=` name in a .desktop file. The task bar finds the entry for
# a running window by matching its Wayland app_id (or X11 WM_CLASS) against `StartupWMClass`,
# which is why the window is drawn with the generic icon until both files are installed.
#
# Everything lands under the XDG data directory, which is per-user by default and needs no root.
